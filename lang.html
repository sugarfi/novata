    imagine lang where one
    describes everything in terms of oneself
    if it can't be described in terms of oneself, it doesn't exist
    one letter = one relation
    and each letter would be followed by a vowel for yes or no
    say b = i am inside, and a = yes and o = no, then ba would be 'a thing i am inside' and bo would be 'a thing i am not inside'
    you could be as specific or vague as you want
    so morpohlogy would be (cv)*
    ideally a few things would be enough
    works for toki pona and esperanto
    would lead to interesting conversations:
    imagine a hypothetical word 'abc', hypothetically meaning 'thing which i am on which is bigger than me which is more flat than me', meaning 'the earth', to a flat earther - after all, they *do* believe it's flat
    when a flat-earther says that word 'abc' to a normal person (who believes the earth is round), the normal person will be like, '...your floor'?
    evokes 1984: if we don't believe in it, it doesn't exist
    if george orwell thought up schr√∂dinger's cat...
