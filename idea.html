let me elaborate <a href="a2.html">a bit</a>. when i say everything is an idea,
i mean that in the context of the 'no-objectivity-only-collective-subjectivity' shit.
stuff is only the way it is because 99% of people say it is. look at math: 2+2 doesnt 'naturally'
equal 4. it equals 4 because the human art collective believes it is (and also believes in constructs
set up around numbers and operators and whatnot.) and conrete things are the same way: a rock is a rock
because the art collective defines what a rock is and defines that thing as one of things that is a rock.
none of this is intrinsic. if we just had light bouncing onto our eyes with no concepts of objects or particles
or space or 3d (or light or eyes), we'd just be little voids, sucking in stuff reflected from objects that
dont really exist since we wouldnt have defined them as existing. only because we define existence and coproraleity (sic)
and physicality and space and light and vision and sight do those things exist.

this is not to say we can change those definitions ad hoc: the 99% is important. one person saying the earth is flat doesn't
make it true, because 99% of other people think otherwise. if the 99% thoughts the earth was flat, it would be, since we would
defined it that way. those particulars theories abouit 'mountains at the edge of teh world' could be disproved or whatever:
we would alter them, maintaining the macor definition, or alter the definition of a mountain or of the edge of a world, changing the
micro definition.

if everyone defines something some way, it is true. keep this in mind. be careful with it.

BUT WAIT!!!!
what if it isn't?
what if its so much more subjective than that
a person who differs from the 99% doesn't care what the 99% think
the 99% happen to all think that, but corellation does not imply causation

the 1% matters

what they believe is real to them
no amount of pressure from the 99% will change their reality
