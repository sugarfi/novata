lets talk about the internet.

whats the problem with the internet?
TROLLS

spammers, trolls, altrighters, assholes.

the internet is notorious for allowing akll these peopole to just do whatever
why is this?

lets look at it in the context of society:
in society, anyone can just walk out do exactly what a spammer or a troll does
i could go outside, find some random people talking, and say 'haha im fucking your mom lol' for hours on end.
yet i don't do that.
but people on the internet do!! why?

one might think it wwas bc of ease of access: anyone can talk to anyone else at the same time
but i would disagree. there are settings in society like this: i can dial a random phone number or send an email to a random address
or even just walk into a random house in a diff country and do the same thing.

so i would propose an alternate cause: lack of good consequences.
notice i didn't say lack of consequences, more on this ina bit.

if i walk to a random house, as described above, somewhere in the world, and start sayiong 'im fucking your mom lol', i will have the
police called on me for breaking and entering an i will be arrested.

if i go on the internet and say 'im fucking your mom' a ton, i will be banned.

not so differnet, right?

it is tho. bc of a thing claled vpns.

lets say i am ipbanned. i can simply hop on a vpn and be back, and repeat this as many times as i want. there is no such option for prison.
one might just think: so remove vpns? no big deal?

but this leads to another problem: people who really *need* vpns, for example whoahave their internet restrictedl, would also lose access. there is no good way to tell who is 'good' and who is 'bad'.

lets go back tyo the prison analogy. image you had a button, offered to everyone in prison, where if they pressed it, they would be released, no questions asked. prisons would be empty overnight! the prison people, seeing this, would remove the button: they wouldn't want any criminals who might be in prison escaping.

but then people who were wrongly convicted would be stuck forever! or people who were arrested for a bad reason, like exercising their free speech. the button can't magically tell who is in prison rightfully (not a lot of people incidentally) and who is not. to do that, (at least atm), tyou would require a guard to assess every prisoner using the button, which has so many problems i wont even begin to alk avout.

and that in essence is my idea of the problem with the internet: there are consequences, but they don't matter. someone says 'cut it out' and it's up to you wthet or not to listen.

thats all.
