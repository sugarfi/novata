she came to a house and put several signs on it. better to let everyone know who had found it (it was her). apparently
someone else had been there. she walked around, took some photos, and kept walking. there was bound to be more stuff to
find and mark.
there was not.
she walked for a while.
maybe she walked forever, who knows.
she certainly didn't.
