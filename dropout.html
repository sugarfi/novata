    <h1>by the third mind of urge overkill and pip</h1>
    <pre>
    whats the matter? its just a burnt out town
    youve been down 
    youve been a dropout
    what happened to you
    to make you feel you need to drop out
    baby aint that a shame when often times people need
    everyone needs sometimes
    lonely child listen
    all the time we have, its just burnt
    yeah we just couldnt, its just one
    yeah youre too old, gotta get away
    too young to be hanging out
    dont you think its strange you gotta get away
    ever since youve been seventeen
    you feel free
    when they call you those names they find it so cool
    just dont see
    breathe, listen to me
    i couldnt see it
    cry, get away, you got to
    die
    in between, youre seventeen
    strange things just change, get away
