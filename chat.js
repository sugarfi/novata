ga790106 -- We cats are very independent. - We need nobody, no time no where, no way. - Isn't that right, Pooky?
ga790107 -- What, ho? - Oh, goody, a blueberry muffin. - ZIPPPPP - - scratch scratch scratch - KICK! - CRASH! - If pardon the expression, there's more than one way to skin a cat.
ga790108 -- Look what my mother made for you, Garfield. - There, how's that? It's nice and warm. - Disgusting, demeaning, itchy and abomination. But, nice and warm.
ga790109 -- Would you just look at this? Jon's making me wear a kitty sweater. - People dress their pets up because it makes them look like little people. Well, I'm NOT a little person, I'm a CAT. - For instance, I like a pinch of catnip in my morning
ga790109 -- cup of coffee.
ga790110 -- Here he comes. Say something nice. - Lookin' good, Garfield. - Sharp sweater, ol' buddy. - Sad. Looks like a meatball in traction.
ga790111 -- I was feeling pretty punk about having to wear a sweater... - Until I saw Odie's new outfit. -
ga790112 -- Uh-oh, it's starting to rain. - I'd better let Garfield in before he gets his new sweater wet. - Too late.
ga790113 -- snicker snicker - HARF! HARF! HARF! -
ga790114 -- When you own a cat, its hairs get everywhere. - Every time I eat, I find a cat hair in my food. Let me show you. - I know it's here something. - - - I CAN'T EAT 'TIL I FIND THAT HAIR! - Silly me. I forgot to put it in there.
ga790115 -- - Garfield, you shouldn't chase the mailman like that. - Now what would you do with him if you actually caught him? I'd eat him.
ga790116 -- Garfield, you know cats can't drink... - SLURP! ...coffee. - Fill 'er up! Well, I'll be dipped.
ga790117 -- - - It's amazing how we've grown to understand each other.
ga790118 -- Look, Garfield. A mouse! - EEEK! -
ga790119 -- Bachelorhood is okay, I guess. - But you just can't beat... - someone waiting for you when you get home.
ga790120 -- BARK! BARK! - ROWR! YAP! FFFT! - And they say pets are therapeutic.
ga790121 -- scratch scratch scratch - Uh-oh. FLEAS! - - - Alcohol should do the trick. - Much better. - puff puff - - FOOMP - There's something to be said for flea collars.
ga790122 -- Garfield, you sleep to much, you eat too much, and you watch too much television. - What does Jon expect of me, anyway? - I'm only human.
ga790123 -- Television can be habit forming. - I've been watching it all day. - Would you like me to turn the TV on, Garfield? That would be nice.
ga790124 -- We've gotta stop watching the all-night movies on television, Garfield. - But, of course, last night was an exception. - Who would possibly turn off the Ethen Barrymore film festival?
ga790125 -- BANG! BANG! EEEK! - SMACK! - Okay, okay. I'll change the channel. I don't like violence.
ga790126 -- I hate television. - There are too many commercials, reruns and game shows. - The eight hours I watched yesterday was terrible.
ga790127 -- Television is only so much mindless drivel... - Glossy adventures, sex and violence. - Ain't it great?
ga790128 -- YAWN! - smack smack smack - Oh my. - Just look at that gorgeous sunrise! - Mother nature certainly uses every color on her vast palette to paint a dawn. Truly blessed are we, the early risers. - Have you ever seen a more beautiful sunset,
ga790128 -- Garfield? - Hmmm...I must have overslept.
ga790129 -- Garfield, you are disgustingly, slovenly, sloppy fat. - Poor Jon. - He obviously has disgustingly, slovenly, sloppy fat confused with "big-boned".
ga790130 -- Brenda, meet Garfield. Hi, Garfield. - Is Garfield a pig? He's a cat. - Oh, that REALLY hurts.
ga790131 -- ahhh - CRASH! - Face it, Garfield. Windowsills just aren't built for us queen-sized felines.
ga790201 -- If you take one bite of my pie, Garfield, I'll smack your fat little paws. - - If I can't have it, neither can he.
ga790202 -- I'll bet you can't wait to see what kind of cat food you're having for dinner. I'll bet I can. - Here it comes... You can cut the tension with a knife. - LIVER! Oh, hooray, hop about, clap paws, squeal with glee.
ga790203 -- Now I wouldn't say you're fat, Garfield... - But when you sit around the sofa, you SIT AROUND the sofa. - KICK! Heads, he lives. Tails, he dies.
ga790204 -- - * - - - - - Let's see...iodine, band-aids, gauze, bullwhip, small straight-jacket, helmet, pan, shampoo, gloves, rinse, conditioner, blow dryer, brass knuckles, towel, rope, elbow pads... - Garfield's bath day? Garfield's bath day.
ga790205 -- I think I'll do some jogging. - Okay...GO, FEET! - Hmmm, reckon the little suckers just weren't in the mood.
ga790206 -- Garfield, I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't read over my shoulder - - READ over my shoulder?
ga790207 -- Stay away from my chicken leg, Garfield. Aw, stuff it in your ear. mrow fft! - WHAT WAS THAT?! - Oh.
ga790208 -- Gee...I wonder which shirt goes better with my slacks. - Lyman, could you give me your opinion on something? Sure. - What can I do for you? Forget it. Beau Brummell lives.
ga790209 -- - - He's trying to tell me to turn the heat up.
ga790210 -- Guess what, Garfield? Somewhere on me is a kittie munchie for you. - - Maybe that wasn't such a good idea. munch munch munch
ga790211 -- NAB! - I'm going to give you a bath, Garfield. You and what army? - - - Okay...I give up. You can go. - SPLOOSH -
ga790212 -- I hate cold floors in the morning. - Nobody likes cold floors. - But we cats have to put twice as many feet on them.
ga790213 -- Pets are great to have on cold nights. - As long as you don't mind... - The crowded conditions.
ga790214 -- BARK! YIP! ROWR! FFFT! - GARFIELD! ODIE! Why don't you boys go outside to fight. - While I lie here and quietly bleed to death.
ga790215 -- * * *  - GARFIELD! Get off the piano! - Talk about stifling one's creative talents.
ga790216 -- There's one nice thing about being a cat at the dinner table. - - Everything you touch is yours.
ga790217 -- What's a six-letter word for "pain," Garfield? - ARRRGH!!! - Is that with three or four r's?
ga790218 -- scrub scrub scrub scrub - - - - CLICK! - GARFIELD! STOP! - It's below freezing out there.
ga790219 -- You say you want me to eat this hamburger, Pooky? - And this chicken? And this lasagna? - You gotta go a long way to find a teddy bear as good as old Pooky here.
ga790220 -- SMACK! - HEY YOU! Come back here and fight like a teddy bear! - What am I saying?
ga790221 -- Be honest, Pooky. Do you think I'm getting a little pudgy around the middle? - - Not a lot of personality, but he certainly knows when to keep his mouth shut.
ga790222 -- - - A dancing bear? Next time, I get to lead.
ga790223 -- Let's go for a walk, little fella. - SMACK! - Well, I'll be. Pooky doesn't like dogs either.
ga790224 -- Okay, who knocked my fern off the windowsill?! - - His lying to me isn't half so upsetting as the credit he's giving my intelligence.
ga790225 -- kaboing kaboing kaboing - purrr - Garfield - bat bat - ROWR! FFFT! - - scratch! scratch! scratch! - That should  hold you cat fans for a while.
ga790226 -- Stand aside, cat. I know karate! - - And I know fast and furious.
ga790227 -- - - Some days I'm just not in the mood to be adored.
ga790228 -- Woould puppy tat wike a bowl of milk? - Would funny wooking man wike a milk bath? - Never be condescending to a cat.
ga790301 -- - GARFIELD! Did you eat my chicken? - No, of course not. If you had, there would be some bones left.
ga790302 -- Be careful around this clock, Garfield. It's an old family heirloom. - CRASH! - One small push for a cat, one giant leap for good taste.
ga790303 -- Where were you, Garfield? I called you an hour ago for dinner. Uh-oh. - KLUNK! - You've got to get to cat food before it sets up.
ga790304 -- tie tie - tie tie tie - yank yank - LEAP! - SPROING! - Booga! Booga! - KLONK! - That was a lot of trouble but it was worth it.
ga790305 -- zzzz YAWN - zzzzz - What a heck of a way to start the week.
ga790306 -- The darn toaster isn't working again. I guess I'll have to fix it. - WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! - First, you have to get its attention.
ga790307 -- Breakfast is on, Garfield. - Carry me. - Sometimes I think I cater to Garfield too much.
ga790308 -- - That's called disco dancing, Garfield. Thank heavens. - For a minute there I thought he had a life carp in his jockey shorts.
ga790309 -- Garfield, that steely-eyed cowcat, roams into town. - He mounts his faithful steed, Odie. - All I need now is a sunset.
ga790310 -- - - Just when you think you've seen your cat do it all...
ga790311 -- buzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz - SPLOOSH - splutter splutter - FLOP! - ptooey! ptooey! ptooey! - wipe wipe - CRASH - If I act casual, maybe he won't notice.
ga790312 -- - SWISH! - The mouth is quicker than the hand.
ga790313 -- - KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! - Nobody home.
ga790314 -- - I suppose I should learn to like Odie. - But I just can't respect anyone who turns around three times to lie down.
ga790315 -- - Hmmm - Just as I suspected. There's a tiny sign in there saying, "Space For Rent".
ga790316 -- BARK! BARK! BARK! - That's good enough. SCREEE POOMP! - Thanks for the exercise. PUNT!
ga790317 --- pat pat pat pat - You didn't see that.
ga790318 -- Hmmm, Jon's drawing board. Hmmm, some paper. Hmmm, some ink. - I think this world would be a nicer place in which to live: If countries could settle their differences without hurting anybody. If everyone smiled at even people they didn't
ga790318 -- know. - If nobody had to steal. I people laughed more. If everyone fed their cats all the lasagna they could eat. If we all took more pride in our homes and our neighborhoods. - If we respected our senior citizens more. If there were no
ga790318 -- violence in movies and television. If everyone could read and write. If families talked more. - If friends hugged more. If everyone stopped at least once a weak to stroke a cat. After all, we're all in this together. - Hey, Garfield. - What's
ga790318 -- this? Oh, just some paw prints.
ga790319 -- I'm going to teach you to do some tricks this week, Garfield. Over my dead body. - Sing for me, Garfield. MROWR! - VERY GOOD! There was a bone in my tuna pate.
ga790320 -- Garfield, go fetch my pipe, paper and slippers. Yes, sir. Right away, sir... - Where IS he? - GARFIELD! Okay, okay. As soon as I'm done with the financial section.
ga790321 -- Roll over, Garfield. You gotta be kidding. - If you roll over, I'll give you a double helping of lasagna. - WHIRRRRRR!
ga790322 -- Speak, Garfield, speak. - Why, of course, Jon. Is there any particular topic on which you'd like to converse? - B-B-B-B-B
ga790323 -- Sit up and beg for the kitty munchy, Garfield. - Tell you what. You give me the munchy and I'll let you keep your face. - I knew that we could arrive at a mutually acceptable compromise.
ga790324 -- Dance for me, Garfield. Not a chance. - If you won't, I'm sure Odie would be happy to. - You have to know what motivates a cat. This is demeaning.
ga790325 -- - - sigh - - Ho hum - - Ever had one of those days when you feel like you've slept and eaten it all?
ga790326 -- Ah, it's early morning for the caped avenger. Ring! - The caped avenger who searches out evil wherever it may lurk. - The late-morning evil, that is.
ga790327 -- The caped avenger sees food! - In order to fight evil, the caped avenger needs food for strength. - Lots and LOTS of strength!
ga790328 -- AHA! The caped avenger sees injustice. BONK! - - Beat it, brute. BOOT!
ga790329 -- The caped avenger sees a large evil person he must destroy in the name of good, because the caped avenger isn't a chicken. - - The caped avenger isn't stupid, either.
ga790330 -- The caped avenger will now fly down and destroy the evil mailman. - - SPLAT! - I think the caped avenger is starting to believe his own press releases.
ga790331 -- The caped avenger will now step outside to fight evil. - - The caped avenger will now step inside and announce his retirement.
ga790401 -- I'm so bored. - Hmmmm - ptu! twing! YIP! SPLOOSH! - BONK! - KICK! - Much better.
ga790402 -- Did you know most cats shed their winter coats in warm weather, Garfield? - FUMP! - Hmmm mus' be spring.
ga790403 -- Spring is here. - The warm spring sun is coaxing trees to bud and flowers to bloom. Fledging songbirds are testing their lilting voices. Soft spring zephyrs are wafting the sweet scent of lilacs. Spring is here. - Big, fat hairy deal.
ga790404 -- There's nothing like a little spring weather to make one feel lazy. - I'd better be careful. - If I were lazier, I could slip into a coma.
ga790405 -- I like spring. - The grass is back from its dormancy. The flowers are back from a long winter's rest. - And the birds are back from Miami.
ga790406 -- I just love to lie out in this warm spring sun. - Uh-oh. - I think I just melted.
ga790407 -- Ah, spring. In the spring a young man's fancy turns lightly to thoughts of love. - - And the street department puts a fresh coat of rust-resistant paint on the fire hydrants.
ga790408 -- click - I'm going to stare at this toaster until the toast pops up. - - - - - - A watched pot never boils, Garfield. Huh? pop - See? Drat...drat, drat, drat, drat.
ga790409 -- Move it, Garfield, I'm going to watch television. - -
ga790410 -- Boy, am I in a bad mood. *Good Morning, Garfield* - POKE! - If there's anything a depressed person hates, it's a cheerful person.
ga790411 -- Garfield's sure been in a nasty mood lately. We'll see about that. Do you know how to treat a mad cat? - - With great, great respect.
ga790412 -- - ROWR! FFFT! - I think I hurt myself.
ga790413 -- I know you've been in a nasty mood this week, Garfield. Many of us occasionally feel angry for no reason at all...psychologists all it a free-floating anxiety. - SPLAT! FREE-FLOAT THIS! - I wonder if this ever happened to Freud.
ga790414 -- Easy, boys. - WE LOVE YOU, GARFIELD! - Darn. That was the best deep blue funk I ever had going.
ga790415 -- scratch scratch scratch - scratch scratch scratch - pat pat pat - scratch scratch pat pat - scratch scratch pat pat -  scratch pat - BARK! YIP! ROWR! - I don't think I could take much more loving.
ga790416 -- Let's go check the mailbox, Garfield. - I love getting mail - It's just another reminder you're alive. That's a pretty heavy thought for a Monday.
ga790417 -- How about some boiled cabbage for lunch, Garfield. - SWIPE! - Or maybe some coleslaw. Now you're talking.
ga790418 -- ARF! ARF! ARF! - - YIP! Sad.
ga790419 -- 'ATTA BOY, GARFIELD! squeak! - GO GET 'IM! squeak! - Take five, little buddy. We'll make another pass in a few minutes. puff puff
ga790420 -- hee he - HA! HA! HA! HA! Poor Lyman. - He wouldn't be laughing so hard if he knew Odie just drank out of the toilet.
ga790421 -- Hmmm - -
ga790422 -- - - Hmmmm - Here, Odie. - - YIP! YIP! YIP! - - GARFIELD! GET OUT OF MY SOCK DRAWER!
ga790423 -- - CRASH! - It's amazing the fun you can have with a hoop.
ga790424 -- Gee, I'd almost forgotten how much fun it is to hang on the old screen door. - SLAM! - And I'd completely forgotten about the pain.
ga790425 -- Hmmm a whistle - - Must be broken.
ga790426 -- Claws are great. - They allow us cats to walk right up trees. - There's only one problem.
ga790427 -- - POP - They don't call me "Lightning Lips" for nothing.
ga790428 -- I just want you people to know how much we cats appreciate you. Without you, who would feed us? Who would love us? - And most important of all... - Who would change our kitty litter?
ga790429 -- GROWL - The cat craves fresh meat. - What-ho, the cat senses unsuspecting quarry o'er yon knoll. - Coiling like a spring, he prepares to lunge. - Steely sinews propel him toward his helpless prey. - Once again a cat's primal instincts provide
ga790429 -- sustenance.
ga790430 -- Boy, I', starved. I think I'll have sausage. hash browns and some eggs over easy. - Good morning, Garfield. Here's tuna and liver surprise! - The sausage and hash browns are delicious. But I do believe the eggs are a bit overdone.
ga790501 -- GASP! CHOKE! BRACK! COUGH! HACK! - FLOP! - Can the melodramatics, Garfield, and finish your liver.
ga790502 -- BURP! - That was rude and crude, Garfield. Cats are more sophisticated than to submit to belching at the dinner table. - BRAACK!
ga790503 -- Tell me what you think of my new poem, Garfield. - "MY BUDDY" I have a buddy. My buddy's a toad. He's kind of muddy, he's flat on the road. But, he is my buddy, my buddy to stay, 'til he's peeled up and sailed away. - Garfield?
ga790504 -- - Uh-oh, here comes Jon! -
ga790505 -- Are you hungry, Odie? - Here, have some celery and tomatoes and radishes. - GARFIELD!
ga790506 -- PURRRR - PURRR - tappity tappity tappity tappity tappity tappity - - scratch! scratch! scratch! scratch! - - Good morning, sunshine. Welcome to another glorious, fun-filled day with your favorite pet! - I'm so happy to own a cat, I could just

ga790507 -- Hey, Lyman. Where's my bread knife? - SLASH! - Never mind.
ga790508 -- This is too good to be true. - BOING! - That WAS too good to be true.
ga790509 -- GOBBLE! GOBBLE! - With all respect to Will Rogers. - I never met a lasagna I didn't like.
ga790510 -- CRASH! - Uh-oh! Here comes Jon. -
ga790511 -- Hello, Julie? How about a movie tonight? Oh, I see. Okay, goodbye. - Darn, she said she was just walking out the door to visit her brother in Tokyo. - That's what I call bad timing. - That's called getting shot out of the saddle, you turkey.
ga790512 -- Garfield, you're getting too fat. - I am NOT getting too fat. - I'm just ready for the next size kitty bed, that's all.

ga790514 -- Boy, what a great meal. - Uh-oh! -
ga790515 -- It was bound to happen. My stomach finally outgrew my legs. - Worse things could happen, I guess. - Like this, for instance.
ga790516 -- Well, you've finally done it, Garfield. Your belly's bigger than your legs. Now what are you going to do? - I'll show you what I'm going to do. - If you'll just roll me over to that lasagna there.
ga790517 -- You're going to have to exercise that belly off, Garfield. - Tell you what. I'll get a leash and take you for a brisk morning drag. - If he had a brain, I'd say he was trying to make a funny.
ga790518 -- * - - boing boing boing
ga790519 -- At last! My feet can touch the floor once more. Never again will I allow myself to get that fat. - And if you believe that, I have a bridge to sell you.
ga790520 -- - - RIDE 'EM, COWCAT! - - BONK! - OH, NO! Odie's hurt his leg! What'll I do? Shoot him.
ga790521 -- I think it's time we take Garfield and Odie out for something to do. - Why do you say that? - They're taking turns on the record player again.
ga790522 -- Cats can be very curious. - SPLOOCH! - Cats can also be very stupid.
ga790523 -- Did I ever tell you about my uncle Harry? He was a famous mouser at a glass plant in Gas City, Indiana. - Legend has it that uncle Harry chased a mouse fight into tank #2 - Now he's a paperweight in Bayonne, New Jersey.
ga790524 -- GRAB! - BONK! - Smooth, move, ol' buddy. have you no respect for the dead?
ga790525 -- Hello, Carolyn? Hey, now about taking in a movie tonight? Uh...oh sure, I understand. - She said she would love to have gone out with me tonight. click - But she had to stay home and pluck her eyebrows. Subtle.
ga790526 -- The darn lawn mower won't work. Let me try. - - brrr! If I could package that look, I'd make a million.
ga790527 -- DING DONG tug tug - Good evening, Felicia, my dear. Dinner awaits. - A loaf of bread, a jug of wine and thou (heh-heh) Oh, brother. - - WAHCHOO! - I'm allergic for cats! Either he goes or I go. SNIFF! - POOMP! - Gee, and she was cute, too.
ga790527 -- Salud.
ga790528 -- Oh, goody. It's Monday morning. BRING! - I love Monday mornings. You know why? - Because *I* don't have to go to work.
ga790529 -- Ah, six A.M. Time to rise and shine. BRING! - First, a light breakfast of juice and toast, then some jogging. - HA-HA-HA! That was a good one.
ga790530 -- Z - Z smack smack - Oh my gosh! I slept through today's strip!
ga790531 -- There's only one drawback to spending a week in bed... - SNIFF! - This blanket is starting to develop a personality all its own.

ga790603 -- - PTOOEY! - - PTOOEY! - - PTOOEY! - Okay, Garfield. Now give me some high lobs.
ga790604 -- Have a package of crackers, Garfield. - RUSTLE CRACKLE CRINKLE - They were terrible. Next time try taking them out of the wrapper.
ga790605 -- Why the droopy demeanor today, Garfield? - KONK! - Never say "droop" to a fat person.
ga790606 -- Hey, Lyman. What do you think of my new tennis racket? - What's it strung with? Catgut. - Aunt Reba!
ga790607 -- That's the trouble with warm weather. - You can't keep ice cubes in your drink. -

ga790610 -- It's only noon, Garfield. Why don't you sleep in today, you deserve the rest. - Hey, Garfield! Let's have some fun! I'll hold Odie down and you beat him up. - How about some exercise, Garfield? Why don't you scratch up my favorite new chair

ga790610 -- had gone out of my life.
ga790611 -- Come on, Garfield. Let's go camping. Not in your life. - Gee, and I'd packed lots of lasagna, too. - Since you put it that way, I reckon there's a trail or two out there that could stand a little blazing.
ga790612 -- Well, here we are in the great outdoors, Garfield. - Ah, wilderness. - Just us, the sky, and the trees. Where's the TV?
ga790613 -- Well, Garfield. - What do you think of camping so far? I don't know. - I've never been this far from the sandbox before.

ga790629 -- Well, Mr. Arbuckle, your cat's basically in good health. - But you'll have to take better care of him. Listen to the doctor, Jon. - He's too fat. Close your ears, boy! The woman's some kind of a quack!
ga790630 -- Tell me, Liz, haven't we met somewhere before? A rice paddy in Hong Kong? - Look, jerk. I'll be the vet for your cat, but I won't play fall guy for your stupid lines. Understood? Uh-huh. - So long, doctor. Have a nice day.

ga790704 -- I'm starting your diet, Garfield. - How would you like this head of cabbage prepared? Deep-fry that sucker. - Boiled it is. What we have here is a failure to communicate.
ga790705 -- Hmmm, diet candy. - Not bad. - A couple more boxes of those things and I'll be skinnier than a rail.
ga790706 -- This diet I'm on has sure made me weak. - PUNT! - * - Drat, he usually clears the piano.

ga790710 -- I've made up my mind. The only way out of this tree is to jump. I may break every bone in my body, but here goes. - - There again...
ga790711 -- Catch the rope, Garfield! - Now tie it around your waist and I'll pull you down. HA-HA-HA! - I'll get Jon for that.
ga790712 -- I've come to rescue you, Garfield. - Uh-oh. - Well, this is just ducky.
ga790713 -- There's only one way out of this tree, Garfield.  - We'll have to jump. - Gee, I'd love to but I simply haven't a thing to wear to our funeral.

ga790720 -- Say, how about popping over to my place for a late-night snack? - Ha-ha-ha. You needn't be afraid of little ol' me. - If you like, you can bring a friend and we'll have dessert, too.

ga790722 -- GO GET 'IM, GARFIELD! - - Opps! SQUEAK! - Everyone stand back! Give him some air! - Artificial respiration might help. - Okay, go, boy! - Phew! For a minute there I thought I was out of a job.
ga790723 -- Come on, Garfield. Let's go see your vet. - She sure is cute. - Why is every time HE gets a hot flash, I have to go to the doctor?
ga790724 -- How about a date, doc? I'd sooner die. - Well don't do *that*. - Nothing like a snappy comeback to save face.
ga790725 -- How about a date, sweetheart? - That's *doctor' to you. - Okay, how about a date, *doctor' sweetheart?
ga790726 -- Tell me, doc. - Do you make house calls? - It's not the veterinary medicine I mind. It's some of the animals I have to work with.
ga790727 -- - Tell me, doctor, what do you suggest for an animal who's madly in love? - I usually prescribe neutering.
ga790728 -- We'll make an appointment for Garfield's next checkup in about six months. - What if there's an emergency? Then you can call me day or night. - Come on, Garfield. Let's go home and play in traffic. That's not funny.

ga801119 -- Why aren't you and grandma getting along? - I married her because she had a figure that wouldn't quit. - So? It did.
ga801120 -- Did I ever tell you about the great famine of '59? It was sad. - Food was so scarce, many people ate their cats. - That's disgusting! And you're gullible.
ga801121 -- You kids have it good these days. - I remember when I had to walk six miles every day just to chase rats. - I don't buy that. Would you believe across the street to spook a chicken?

ga801210 -- Why would Jon want to have me declawed? A cat without claws is like a bee without a stinger... - A porcupine without quills, a shark without teeth, a snake without fangs! - I think I see his point.
ga801211 -- Granted, declawing a cat may spare the furniture. But it also renders a cat defenseless. - Put yourself in my shoes...how would you like to go through life... - Knowing somewhere out there is a dog with your name on it.
ga801212 -- Some friends of mine and I would like to discuss this declawing idea of yours. - - Thanks, friends.
ga801213 -- Garfield, I'm sorry I tried to have you declawed. Let's forgive and forget, okay? - BUZZ - I'll settle for "forgive".
ga801214 -- OH BOY! CHICKEN! I LOVE CHICKEN! - Hold it, Garfield. - I don't know how to break this to you. I know it's going to break your heart... - But, I'm never letting you have chicken again. You might choke on the bones. - - - OH BOY! HAMBURGERS! I
ga801214 -- LOVE HAMBURGERS! What? No period of mourning?
ga801215 -- I think it's time you met a lady cat, Garfield. - And if you're not sure what to do on a date just watch me in action sometime. I have. - Make an inuendo, get slapped. Make a suggestion, get slapped. Make a move, get slapped.
ga801216 -- Jon says this after shave is supposed to attract women. - gallop gallop gallop gallop - Darn...wrong species.
ga801217 -- It's time I met a cat of the female persuasion. - - What took you so long?
ga801218 -- What do they call you? - My name's Arlene. - And what do they call that space between your front teeth? This relationship is off to a tenuous start.
ga801219 -- - Wanna eat mice? Wanna beat up dogs? - How barbaric. how nauseating.
ga801220 -- Tell me, Arlene, what good is that space between your teeth? - *** - When will I see you again? Next time I want to hail a taxi.

ga801222 -- Garfield, would you happen to know what happened to the lasagna I fixed for dinner? - * - I didn't know you could whistle. I'd tap-dance too if it would change the subject.
ga801223 -- Did I ever tell you I'm 29, Garfield? - You would have been 30 but you were sick a year. I would have been 30  but I was sick a year. - MY KINGDOM FOR A NEW PUNCH LINE!

ga801228 -- - No sweat, sarge. I'll take that machine gun nest out with my trusty bazooka here. - So this is what it feels like to be potato salad. - Rhett, rhett. Whatever shall I do? Wherever shall I go? - Take me to your leader, earthling, or I'll
ga801228 -- atomize your face. - That food's for eating, Garfield. What are you trying to do? Make me sick or something?

ga810110 -- Boy, what a great night's sleep. YAWN - HEY, GARFIELD. LET'S GO JOGGING. - Z
ga810111 -- What happened to my favorite record? I scratched it. - What happened to the lasagna I fixed for dinner?! I ate it. - GARFIELD; WHY IS IT YOU SCRATCH, EAT AND DESTROY EVERYTHING IN SIGHT?! I CAN'T HELP IT! I'M A SLAVE TO MY PASSIONS! - CATS!
ga810111 -- HUMANS! - I'm sorry, Garfield. If you didn't do those things you wouldn't be a cat. I love you for what you are. That's okay. - What happened to my fern? Don't ask.
ga810112 -- Stand aside, boy. There's lasagna to be eaten! - - We have an understanding, Garfield and I...I provide the food, shelter, and affection, and he provides the abuse.
ga810113 -- ROWRRRR - elbow - EROWR Prima donna.
ga810114 -- I've been watching television too long. - I'd better take a break. -
ga810115 -- - You eat too fast, Garfield. says who? - BURP
ga810116 -- - - A seeing eye dog.
ga810117 -- What's with you? - Someone switched my eyedrops with the airplane glue. That's terrible! - No wonder my model airplane wouldn't stick together.
ga810118 -- - We're going for a nature walk, Garfield. Super. - Just smell that fresh country air. Sniff...ACHOO! - Hark. That's the call of a lesser bittern of the heron family. WAKA, WAKA Waka, smaka. - Rolling meadows, lush forests, majestic
ga810118 -- mountains... - Have you ever seen such splendor? Lovely.
ga810119 -- YAWN - TRIP! - It must be Monday.
ga810120 -- SLUP - That was my hot water, Garfield. I was going to make tea. I know that. - Weird.
ga810121 -- That's the biggest bird I've ever seen! - - Garfield, time to eat.
ga810122 -- I can see the headlines now. - "Cat gets hijacked". - "And duck gets hernia"
ga810123 -- Flying looks pretty simple. - - AARRRRGG
ga810124 -- Oh pooh. - Oh goody. - Oh pooh. City Pound
ga810125 -- City Pound SLAM! - How did I get into this fix? One minute I'm free as a bird, then I'm in the city pound. Where did I go wrong? - I'm just a number here. I've almost forgotten what it's like on the outside. - IT'S NOT RIGHT TO CAGE A WILD
ga810125 -- ANIMAL! - THESE FOUR WALLS ARE CLOSING IN ON ME! I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE! - You've only been here two minutes. I know, but this is my first shot at a prison scene.
ga810126 -- I can't believe it. Me, Garfield, in a dog pound. - That's "City Pound." There are cats here too, you know. - Arf arf. Oh shut up, fluffy.
ga810127 -- My name's Guido, and this here is my associate, Fluffy. - Guido and Fluffy? - I've killed for less than that. One of your sensitive-tough types.
ga810128 -- Tell me, Guido.  Why is Fluffy here in the city pound? - His previous owner encountered considerable difficulty in cultivating Fluffy with the proper hygienic habits. - Couldn't be housebroken, huh? Puddle City.
ga810129 -- How long will I have to stay here in the pound? Till your owner comes to pick you up. - What if he doesn't come? Then it's curtains for you. - Great! I love to sharpen my claws on curtains. How do I break this to him?
ga810130 -- We gotta bust out of this pound. Got any ideas? Why don't we use Fluffy as a battering ram? - FLUFFY! BE A BATTERING RAM! Yah. - CRASH!
ga810131 -- Thanks for helping me escape from the pound, Guido. No sweat. - It's nice to finally be out of trouble. What a relief it is to be returning to the safety and comfort of home. - Whatever that is...
ga810201 -- - - Why, hello there. I'm lost. - Aren't you cute! Can you give me directions! - Run along now, Kitty. - - - What did I do?
ga810202 -- So what if I'm lost. Big deal. I can handle it. - Cats are adventurous. Cats are independent. Cats are strong... - I WANT MY TEDDY BEAR!
ga810203 -- It should be no problem finding my way home. Cats have a natural homing instinct. - My instinct tells me to go that way. - BONK!
ga810204 -- FOOD! I GOTTA HAVE FOOD! - Health Food Store - FOOD! I GOTTA HAVE FOOD!
ga810205 -- Boy, am I beat. I must've walked two blocks today. - It will be nice to get home. I miss my chew bone, my chew toy, - And Odie, my chew dog.
ga810206 -- I guess I'll have to hitchhike home. - Fortunately for me, I have something most other cats don't. - Thumbs.
ga810207 -- GARFIELD! WELCOME BACK! - I'm starved. You must be starved. I'll get some food. - Home is where they understand you.
ga810208 -- * * - * *  ** - ** ? ** - ** - * * - ***!
ga810209 -- MY FEET! WHERE ARE MY FEET?! - - Maybe I could stand to lose a pound or two.
ga810210 -- Garfield, you won't say you're fat... - But you have more chins than a Hong Kong telephone directory! -
ga810211 -- I wish Jon wouldn't kid me about my weight. - I'm a very sensitive person. - Et tu, chair?
ga810212 -- My, my, a chocolate covered peanut. - RIP! - I think I need a bigger cat suit.
ga810213 -- - - Sorry about that.
ga810214 -- GARFIELD! DINNER! - I appreciate your promptness, Garfield... - BUT, NEXT TIME, OPEN THE DOOR! Oops.
ga810215 -- Watch out, Metropolis. Garfield is in town. - This is my night to howl. - AROOO - Hey, baby, what's happenin' Buzz off, creep. - arooooo - Hi there, how about a kiss? Don't do me no favors. - How about you and me. Pack it in, jack. - aroooo.
ga810216 -- Uh-oh. It's diet time. - Let's diet together, Garfield. That would be more fun. - How does the old proverb go? "Misery loves company".
ga810217 -- Welcome to the first day of your diet, Garfield. - Through self-denial, you will realize a slimmer, more self-assured you. - I THINK I'M GONNA DIE!
ga810218 -- I shall now attempt to eat a lunch consisting of one leaf of lettuce. - Lightly seasoned with... - One quart of mayonnaise! BLOP
ga810219 -- Dieting is easy when you set your mind to it. - I no longer crave food. - IT'S THE CALORIES I CRAVE!
ga810220 -- - - I gotta get off this diet!
ga810221 -- Zowie! A picture of lasagna! - RIP! - Not too bad except for the staples. ptooey
ga810222 -- SNAP! - I love static electricity. scuff scuff scuff scuff - POP! - SCUFF SCUFF SCUFF SCUFF SCUFF - POW - I hate static electricity.
ga810223 -- BRINNNNG! - I love to wake up early. - The earlier you set your alarm, the longer you can oversleep.
ga810224 -- It's yawn and crick time. - YAWN - CRICK!
ga810225 -- Eat your food, Garfield. No, It's youkky. - How would you like to go to bed without dinner? - Somehow, that psychology doesn't seem to work on Garfield.
ga810226 -- Why do people love teddy bears? - It's for their don'ts... - They don't eat your food. They don't dance with your date and they don't trump your ace lead.
ga810227 -- - I wonder what grandiose dream Garfield is having right now. -
ga810228 -- Have you ever seen such a sad movie in all your life, Garfield? - Maybe I'm too hardened. Maybe I'm too cynical... - But I wasn't that moved by "Flipper Gets The Ick".
ga810301 -- - I declare this chair the sole property of Garfield The Cat. - Move it, Garfield. That's my chair. My chair. - MY CHAIR! MY CHAIR! - MY CHAIR! MY CHAIR! - KICK! My chair. My cushion.
ga810302 -- GRRR ROWR - EYOUCH! - One should not bare one's claws while lying on them.
ga810303 -- Claws. - THOCK! - The only way to eat olives.
ga810304 -- What's this welling up within my soul? - By golly, it's my primal urges. - Civilization as we know it may come to an end now that the CLAW is here!
ga810305 -- The Claw spots groceries. - ZIP! - What a lousy epitaph..."he shuffled off this mortal oil at the hand of canned goods".
ga810306 --The Claw spots boy with balloon. - POW! - The claw enjoys a cruel laugh at a young child's expense. WAH!
ga810307 -- The Claw sets out to wreak havoc. - CRASH BAM SMASH WHAM - The claw gets his havoc wreaked by the fang.
ga810308 -- - Poor me. - All alone in the rain...nobody notices, nobody cares. - I think I'll catch pneumonia and die.  That'll make'm feel bad. - GARFIELD! GET IN HERE! - Everyone needs a good bout with self-pity now and then.
ga810309 -- I'm putting you into training, Garfield. - CATCH THE MOUSE! KILL THE MOUSE! CHASE IT! - I'm disappointed in you. You're just another dumb animal. If I wait for the forward thrust to diminish, I should be able to retrieve it at my leisure.
ga810310 -- Garfield, where's your windup mousie? - You didn't...? No of course you didn't. - ptooey
ga810311 -- GET THAT MOUSE, GARFIELD! What mouse? Squeak - I KNOW IT'S THERE. I HEAR IT SQUEAK, NOW DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT! Squeak - koink koink koink
ga810312 -- CATCH THAT MOUSE, GARFIELD! - Now what do I do with it? Eat it! - Who knows where that mouse has been?
ga810313 -- Why do people expect us cats to eat mice? - This mouse could be somebody's mother. This mouse could be a deacon in its little mouse church. - And some of the fuzzy sucker's bones might get caught in my throat.
ga810314 -- KILL THE MOUSE, GARFIELD! - NO! I RESPECT MY WARMBLOODED BROTHERS AND SISTERS MORE THAN THAT! - I'll reserve my abuse for the lower life forms.
ga810315 -- - Cats can stare anything down. - - I win. - - I win again. - Uh oh. - This one's going to be tough.
ga810316 -- Oh Marcia. Oh Bob. - kissy kissy smooch - It's time Jon had another date. kiss
ga810317 -- It's time to go to the veterinary clinic, Garfield.  - Sometimes I think Jon uses me as an excuse to see that lady vet. SLAM - Especially when he forgets to take me along.
ga810318 -- Hellooo, doc. Remember me? Where's your cat? - Forget my cat. Can't we get started without him? Sure. - First a vitamin E shot to give your coat a keener sheen. I'll get my cat.
ga810319 -- How a bout a date, my little kitten? - I don't date men who who use animal names out of context. - Rats.
ga810320 -- Why don't you like me? - You're wishy-washy, crude, and a twerp. - I mean aside from that.
ga810321 -- Your cat is extremely overweight, Mr. Arbuckle. It could lead to serious heart problems. Not to worry. - I don't think Garfield has a heart. - See?!
ga810322 -- - I'm going to jog this morning. - Of course, it will be cold when I start. - But then I'll get hot and sweaty. - And my heart will pound, making me dizzy. - I'll get blisters on my feet. - Then I'll be stiff and sore for days. - Jogging
ga810322 -- probably wouldn't be so bad. But the anticipation is killing me.
ga810323 -- I wonder what today is? - BONK! - Monday.
ga810324 -- There are two of us and only one donut, Garfield. Let's share it. - - Where's my share? Look closely. I left the hole for you.
ga810325 -- bark! bark! bark! - - I fail to see the sport in it.
ga810326 -- Ah, a screen door upon which to hang. - - They don't make'm like they used to.
ga810327 -- Hello. What's this? - Don't panic, Garfield. It's only a little rain. - AAAAAAAAAAAAA
ga810328 -- I love lasagna fresh from the oven: the tomato sauce, the meat, the melted cheese. - - GARFIELD!
ga810329 -- I', going out, Garfield. The women will be hysterical over me. The outfit's hysterical. - What do you think about my attire? It could use some alteration. - Let's tuck that tie in and add some vents to the sleeves. - - A smart cat knows just
ga810329 -- how far to go without crossing over the line. - Perhaps a more rakish tilt to the hat. -
ga810330 -- Just remember, Garfield, when we get to the farm you are there to relax. - I know last time you wanted to be helpful... - But you do not grow chickens by planting chickens in the ground! It was an hones mistake.
ga810331 -- Mothers equate love with food. When they feed you they're saying, "I love you". - Eat, eat, eat. - And I love you, too.
ga810401 -- The light bulb's burned out. - Don't worry about me, I'll just sit here in the dark going blind. - I'll fix it. He's such a good boy.
ga810402 -- When I was your age I was married and had a kid. Yeh, me! - - Good argument, son. But I still think you should get married.
ga810403 -- Now that the sun has set, we come to the exciting part. - We turn around to watch the moon rise. - Be still my beating heart.
ga810404 -- It IS kind of pretty out here on the farm. - chirp chirp - Walt Disney, eat your heart out.
ga810405 -- - Uh oh. I'll never make it across that sunbeam awake. - Nothing ventured, nothing gained. - Z poomp! - Come on , Garfield, let's go for a walk. Z - Z Z
ga810406 -- You're getting a little pudgy there, Garfield. - Maybe you'd be more attractive to the ladies if you'd suck your gut in. - And then again, maybe not.
ga810407 -- Here comes Arlene. She's crazy about me. - Buenos dias, mon sweet. I knew you'd come back to me. - Of course you did, fatso. You're sitting on my rubber mouse.
ga810408 -- Tell me, Arlene, how does it feel to have a huge, ugly, disgusting gap between your front teeth? - BAP! - Oh.
ga810409 -- ROWR OOOO - Why do cats always caterwaul when they date? Would you rather come to my place and see my cat show trophy? - EROOO
ga810410 -- How about us having a lasting relationship, Garfield? - I'm sorry, Arlene. I'm already hopelessly in love with somebody else. - Who? Me.
ga810411 -- Thanks for the date, Arlene. How about a good night kiss? - kiss kiss smack kiss - Masher.
ga810412 -- - Aren't pet stores fascinating, Garfield? - The cute hamsters, the canaries, the tropical fish. - Garfield? - GARFIELD?!! - Oh, there you are. - Come on, let's go home for lunch. No thanks, I just ate.
ga810413 -- Where were you last night, Garfield? - - You met a ballet dancer and went to a sack race? Close enough.
ga810414 -- Z - BARK! -
ga810415 -- yip! yip! YIP! YIP! - -
ga810416 -- If there is such a thing as reincarnation, I'd like to come back as a movie star. - What would you like to come back as, Garfield? What a silly question. - A dogcatcher, of course.
ga810417 -- Mornin', Jon. What'll you have? Ham'n'eggs, eggs over easy. - And what'll you have, sir? - One of each will do nicely, thank you.
ga810418 -- Garfield. Cats can't walk on their hind feet. - I didn't know that. -
ga810419 -- dial dial - Hello, Ingrid? How about a date this weekend? - Okay...then how about next weekend? How about the weekend after that? - Maybe the weekend after that? Or the weekend after that? The next one? How about the weekend after that? -
ga810419 -- Look Ingrid, if you don't want to go out with me, why don't you just say so! - SLAM! - I guess I told her. String 'em along then break their hearts. Right, Jon?
ga810420 -- The moon is right. - The time is right. - Good evening, ladies and germs. A funny thing happened on the way here tonight...
ga810421 -- A canary walks up to me the other day and he says, "I haven't had a bite in three days." So you know what I did? - I ate him! - Yah dah dah dah dah dah tappity tappity tappity
ga810422 -- O solo MEYOW - - I know you're out there. I can hear you breathing.

ga810425 -- Take my dog...please. - What's that? - HOOK!
ga810426 -- BRING! - Good morning, Garfield. Here's your yummy breakfast. - SPLAT! Yuk. - scratch RIP! scratch - Chirp chirp - EEEEEK! - Just another day in the life of a typical cat.
ga810427 -- Why were cats placed upon this earth? - Why, to give people pleasure. - And to give dogs a hard way to go. SMACK!
ga810428 -- There's nothing like a steaming cup of coffee and a newspaper to get the day started. - - I'd enjoy it even more if I could read.
ga810429 -- ROWR - -
ga810430 -- Once again I venture into the wilderness in search of quarry. - I spot my prey, but I must make a clean kill. - Hamburgers can be vicious if they're only wounded.
ga810501 -- I eat too much, I sleep too much and I don't exercise at all. - There's certainly room for improvement. - I think I'll take up smoking.
ga810502 -- - gobble gobble gobble gobble - It's been a big day.
ga810503 -- - MROW OOOO - ROWRR UR - AROOOOOOO - Thanks for the date, Garfield. Take care, Arlene. -

ga810506 -- - -
ga810507 -- How do you feel about jogging this morning, Garfield? - How do you feel about bleeding this morning. - I get your drift. Bright lad.
ga810508 -- If you want to eat, use this can opener, Garfield. - You know what to do with it. Yes, I do. - Gimme a steak.
ga810509 -- - Okay, who put eyeballs on my hamburger? -
ga810510 -- - WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU, GARFIELD?! - You were walking down the street minding your own business... - SNIFF You stopped to smell a flower... - When a big dog slipped up behind you... - CLOBBER - And beat the stuffing out of you. You are so
ga810510 -- right.
ga810511 -- Hey, Garfield, what do you think of my new wallpaper? - - I like it.
ga810512 -- If I were the cruel sort, I'd shove Odie off the table. - But I'm not. - Teddy bears, on the other hand... BOMP!
ga810513 -- GET OUT OF MY CHAIR. OUT! OUT! - Pooky wants to watch television . I guess I know where I fall in the order of things.
ga810514 -- I have a new diet for you, Garfield. You can eat all you want. - After eating five pounds of carrots! -
ga810515 -- Garfield, you hang around the house too much. - What can I do to interest you in the great outdoors? - You can screen it in and out a roof over it, for starters.
ga810516 -- - NAP ATTACK! - I hate him. Z
ga810517 -- I wonder if I could stand on just two feet? - Hey, this is great! I'm standing! - Now I can tap-dance. tap tap tap tappity tap tap - And I can reach the tabletop. - And drop-kick Odie. DROP KICK! - Garfield! Cats can't walk on their HIND

ga810520 -- - There's only one thing I like about cars. - The upholstered ceilings.
ga810521 -- - Garfield! Get out of there! - The light DOES turn off when the glove compartment is closed.
ga810522 -- boing boing - Are you bored, Garfield? - We'll find out how bored I am if I don't get to a litter box soon.
ga810523 -- Get out of the car, Garfield. - Let us bask in the sun and sleep with nature's creatures, Garfield. - Translation: "Let's bake our brains and lie on the ground with bugs and snakes, Garfield".
ga810524 -- Well, here we are in the wilds, Garfield. Keep a sharp eye out for wild animals. - WHAT?! - WHA...?! - You're just fooling me, aren't you? - - Oh, no, you don't, Garfield. - I'll wise up to your tricks if it's the last thing I do.
ga810525 -- Come on across the creek, Garfield. - I don't know why you cats are so afraid of a little mud. - You would be too if you had to wash yourself with your tongue.
ga810526 -- Welcome to our first night of camping, Garfield. enjoy. - ROAR! - You enjoy. I'll be waiting in the car.
ga810527 -- Lock your door, Garfield. This is a tough neighborhood. - I know. - How often do you see kids having a fire hydrant eating contest?
ga810528 -- - -
ga810529 -- - - Tell me that's not a traffic cop's hat you're wearing, Garfield. Okay, it's not a traffic cop's hat.

ga810602 -- Out! - You can scratch my chair, you can insult my mother, you can beat up my dog, and you can play with my rubber mousie... - But you don't eat my food and you don't sleep into my bed. Yes, sir.
ga810603 -- We cats are very independent. - We don't need attention. - Unless it's being given to someone else.
ga810604 -- Come here, Nermal. - Make yourself useful. - Where are you going? Trolling for dogs.
ga810605 -- - MINE! - Pooky is a one-cat teddy bear.
ga810606 -- I guess I'll be leaving. Must you rush? - If you insist, I'll stay. -

ga810615 -- It's Monday. Nothing good ever happens to me on mondays. - So I'm going to stay in the middle of this big field all day, where I can't get hurt. - SPOING!
ga810616 -- Claire, baby! What say you and I go out tonight and paint the town red, sweets? - Yeh, maybe another time? - Now who should I call? Try Clods Anonymous.
ga810617 -- Hellooo, Mary. Say, good lookin', where have you been all my life? - I see...you lived on Main Street until you were two, then you moved to Rosewood where you presently reside. - Shall I ask her out, Garfield? Sounds like a match made in
ga810617 -- heaven.
ga810618 -- Hanging on the screen door was more dangerous in olden times when people threw their dishwater out. - GOOSH - Old habits die hard.
ga810619 -- I can hear them sneaking up behind me now. - They are crouching, getting ready to leap. - HAPPY BIRTHDAY, GARFIELD! What a wonderful surprise!
ga810620 -- - - GARFIELD! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? SPEAK TO ME! I'm not speaking to you.
ga810621 -- - I'm bored. - Bored, bored bored. - There must be more things to do on a screen door than just hang there. - - - - Nice going, dummy.
ga810622 -- There you are, Garfield. A genuine Naugahyde leash. - How inhumane! How cruel! - Do you know how many naugas they killed to make this leash?
ga810623 -- - ROWRR!! - hop hop
ga810624 -- Where are you going, Jon? I'm breaking Garfield to the leash. - He doesn't like it much, does he? How can you tell?
ga810625 -- - -
ga810626 -- You wait here while I go into the store. - Leashes are the greatest things since sliced bread. - By the way, don't forget the frozen lasagna.
ga810627 -- You know, Garfield, I've come to realize leashes aren't right for cats. - Now there's a news flash for you. - Next he will come to realize icebergs weren't right for the Titanic.
ga810628 -- Sit up. - Roll over, Odie. - Speak. Urf. - Play dead. - Beg. - WHERE'S YOUR PRIDE?!
ga810629 -- I hate rain. - I'm so depressed. - Happiness is only a fair weather friend.
ga810630 -- - WAHCHOO! - Floral print.
ga810701 -- - WAHCHOO! - SNIFF
ga810702 -- Dear Garfield, How do I avoid the embarrassment of cat hair all over my house when I have company? Harried. - Simple. - Never invite anyone to your home again.
ga810703 -- I love sunny windowsills. - - And I hate open windows.
ga810704 -- - - Stay away from rocking chairs. Sound advice.
ga810705 -- - - - Oh yuk! - What did you drag that fish in for? - SMACK! BONK! - When a cat presents you with a dead, smelly thing, it's an expression of love, you twit.
ga810706 -- Here's a lesson in the natural order of things. - Cats use claws to climb up trees. - And fire departments to get down.
ga810707 -- What does Garfield the cat do when he's stuck up a tree? - Why what any honorable cat would do, of course. - WAHHH!
ga810708 -- I'm getting out of this tree. - BOING! - I didn't allow for my resilient nature.
ga810709 -- Poor me..stuck up a tree. - Things could be worse, I guess. -
ga810710 -- Why do I always get stuck up trees? - It must be the cat in me. - Right on.
ga810711 -- Come here, cat. ROWR! - ROWR FFT! Here you are, cat. kiss Thanks.
ga810712 -- Oh good, it's here. - This rubber burger should be good for some laughs. - CHOMP! - SPROING! - ROWR! Hee hee. - GRRRR HA! HA! HA! - - It was worth it.
ga810713 -- - - You could've asked me to pass the salt. Cats don't ask. Cats take.
ga810714 -- Just look at yourself, Garfield. You're becoming a soft, sugar dependent, grease-eating lard ball. Is that what you want? - YES! - Let me rephrase that...
ga810715 -- Some people say I'm fat. - Big deal, I love to eat. - Waddling and sweating is kind of fun too.
ga810716 -- - BASH! - Good morning, fatso. All I did was jump off the bed.
ga810717 -- It isn't healthy for a cat to be as big as you are, Garfield. - Why, you could get heart disease, get fallen arches... - Get harpooned. Couldn't resist it could you.
ga810718 -- - CRASH - Maybe I should go on diet.
ga810719 -- Let me give you a driving session, Garfield. - When you're as good a driver as I am, you drive defensively. - You look both ways at an intersection. - Then you proceed with caution. - HONK! SCREEEE! - Darn you, Garfield. I'm such a kidder.
ga810720 -- I think you're eating too much salt, Garfield. I'm going to take it out of your diet. - If you must. - But I'm sure going to miss my salt lick.
ga810721 -- I'm putting you on a diet, Garfield. OH NO! - I may have to resort to desperate emergency measures. - Like chasing mice.
ga810722 -- I'm going to start you on your diet slowly, Garfield. - For the rest of the week you may have no desserts. Fine and dandy. - Helloooo, main course.
ga810723 -- Hello, ice cream. Hello, hamburger. Hello, lasagna. - Get away from the refrigerator, Garfield. You're on a diet. - What were you doing? Just visiting some old friends.
ga810724 -- I'm on a diet again. What a bummer. - Soon there will be less of me around. - I'm going to miss me.
ga810725 -- - - The lost-your-will-to-live phase of the diet, huh? Let me die in peace.
ga810726 -- - - - - - - Going to do some singing on the ol' fence tonight? Music is my life.
ga810727 -- Hello. What's this? - - I hate mondays.
ga810728 -- Garfield, Garfield, Garfield. You ate my fern. I'm a bad boy. - Now I'll have to go buy another one. - I hope it tastes better than this one.
ga810729 -- - - MMMPH
ga810730 -- Good morning, Garfield. - Don't speak to me just yet. - Some people have no respect for slow risers.
ga810731 -- - - In the flower garden again, Garfield? How'd you guess?
ga810801 -- Do you know what this country needs? More dog pounds. - Anti-dog mines around fire hydrants! Dog hunting season! Dog traps! - Relax, Garfield. You're going to burst something. Why, millions could be saved on carpet cleaning bills alone.
ga810802 -- * - Garfield, lasagna! - - - I waxed the table today. When my bones knit, you are a dead man.
ga810803 -- - - You know it's Monday when you find sharks circling in your water bowl.
ga810804 -- I'm in the mood for a good fight, but I am personally opposed to senseless violence. - PUNT! - That's for not being a cat.
ga810805 -- Hey look, Garfield. This is my impression of a bowling ball. - SHOOP! - That was my impression of a vacuum cleaner.
ga810806 -- I feel like getting into a big fight today. - - Now I feel like holing up somewhere to whimper for a while.
ga810807 -- What do you want to do tonight, Garfield? Do you want to go jogging? Go to a movie? Play miniature golf. - Or would you rather go eat? - Natch.
ga810808 -- Do you take your cat everywhere? - Yes, we do everything together, my dear. - Except make passes at ugly waitresses.
ga810809 -- Here it comes, folks. - Tah-dah! - - Lasagna anyone? I'll pass. Nope. I'm on a diet. I think I'll wait for dessert. I just ate.
ga810810 -- I wonder where I should go on vacation. - Maybe France or Spain... - Or Mexico.
ga810811 -- Garfield, I've decided to take a vacation. Great! When do we leave? - I don't think you understand. I said "I", not "we". - Say you're just kidding. I think you understand.
ga810812 -- I can't believe Jon's not taking me on vacation. - Cats need vacations too. - All this eating and sleeping can wear a guy down.
ga810813 -- Aunt Gussie, would you take care of my cat while I'm gone on vacation? ...terrific! - You know aunt Gussie, Garfield. She's a sweet old lady. - How can you say that about someone who used to double date with Lizzie Borden?
ga810814 -- Garfield, meet aunt Gussie. - I'm tickled pink to meet you. - And you can color me unimpressed.
ga810815 -- While I'm gone take good care of Garfield. - And keep a close eye on him. He gets a lot of mischief. - Have fun, Garfield. Garfield?
ga810816 -- - pat pat pat - - POOMP! - I would have had to eat him to save face.
ga810817 -- Stowing away in Jon's suitcase is thirsty work. - GLUCK GLUCK GLUCK - Even after shave lotion tastes good if you're dry enough.
ga810818 -- Look out, sunny beaches. - Here comes Don Juan. - And his sidekick, Lawrence of Boxer Shorts.
ga810819 -- I can't believe you stowed away in my suitcase, Garfield. - I'll bet you don't even know where we are. - A tourist trap would be a safe assumption.
ga810820 -- That's the trouble with vacation spots. - This hamburger is terrible! - What do you expect for a lousy $23,50?
ga810821 -- This is the life, Garfield. - You know you're on vacation when you see women in bikinis, hibiscus blossoms in the pool... - And la cucarachas in the sock drawer.
ga810822 -- Pardon me...I believe I dropped my nobel peace prize around here somewhere. Beat it, crap. - -
ga810823 -- Hey, Garfield, guess what? - The dog next door is being given a birthday party today. - This brick should make a spiffy gift. - - BONK! YIP! - YIP! Happy birthday, dog. - - Hello, doctor? Do you think you could surgically remove my cat from a
ga810823 -- dog?
ga810824 -- Hey, Garfield. It says here they are holding auditions for a cat food commercial. - Would you be interested? - Have my agent give the script a look-see.
ga810825 -- To win the cat food commercial audition you'll have to be a convincing eater. - Can you handle that? Are you kidding? - When it comes to eating, I'm a genius.
ga810826 -- Imagine me doing a cat food commercial. - Next there'll be the movie offers, the screaming fans, the limousines... - Belly, you and I are going places.
ga810827 -- Is this where my cat auditions for the cat food commercial? Yeh. - Hey, Larry. Break out the wide-angle lens. - If I don't get the part, the director is going to be sporting those shades up his right nostril.
ga810828 -- Okay, food commercial audition take one, action! That stuff looks awful. - CUT! - You're supposed to eat it, cat. What's my motivation
ga810829 -- Okay, cat food commercial audition take two, action! - Yuk! - Mmph grp bruf What's the director saying, Garfield? Loosely translated, I don't fit the part.
ga810830 -- - Good morning, Garfield. - - - SLUP - * Good morning *
ga810831 -- Well, if it isn't Nermal, the Shirley Temple of the feline set. - How's it going, Nermal? Oh, about the same. I'm overadored as usual. -
ga810901 -- Do you know why I hate Nermal? - It's not because he's so young , tiny and cute... - He reminds me I'm so old, fat and ugly.
ga810902 -- - I can't reach that pie, Nermal. What say we team up? -
ga810903 -- Maybe I could be as popular as Nermal if I learned to dance. - - I think I hurt something.
ga810904 -- MINE! - - Yours.
ga810905 -- Sorry you have to leave so soon, Nermal. But, I wasn't... - - I'm not afraid of him wearing out his welcome. I don't want him to break in a new one.
ga810906 -- I'll have a steak, fries and a large Cola. - And my cat here will have an order or lasagna. - WHAP! - Make that a double order. - BONK! - Perhaps a triple order. - GOOSH! - Heck with it. Give him the whole pan. And give it wings.
ga810907 -- - SWIPE! - I hate mondays.
ga810908 -- Hee hee - HA HA HA! - When you're built low to the ground, a walk in the grass can be ticklish.
ga810909 -- Hello, tree. Hello, flowers. - Hello, apteryx. -
ga810910 -- There you have it, folks. - Medical science has a cure for almost everything but the common cold... - And the early morning stares.
ga810911 -- Surprise, Garfield! I got you a scratching post. Gee, thanks. - - scratch scratch scratch
ga810912 -- YAWN - ARRRGH! - Why are you wearing my reading glasses? All the better to scane you with, my dear.
ga810913 -- - - rats! - I went and did it again. - Here I am, doomed to die again. If I stay up here I'll starve. If I jump I'll become a cat pancake. I hope someone rescues me. - Stuck up th tree again, Garfield? Help! Help!
ga810914 -- Rats, I'd like to sleep in this morning, but I'm hungry too. - * - Z

ga810916 -- Ha ha ha! What a great plot, fine acting, super photography. - I love commercials.
ga810917 -- - - You're no longer a kitten, Garfield.
ga810918 -- If cats can run up trees, why can't cats run DOWN trees as well? - - Garfield, you are very, very stupid.
ga810919 -- Owning a pet is ideal for single people. We have companionship without the hassle of raising a family. - - Wipe your feet before coming into the house! Okay, dad.
ga810920 -- - Shoo, mice. Get out of my vitamin pills. - Mice get into everything. - Somebody could chase them out of here. - I wonder why they wanted the vitamins? - It beats me.
ga810921 -- Guess what, Garfield? We are going back to the farm. - It will be nice to get back in touch with mother nature. - When you find her, give her my best.
ga810922 -- It will be nice seeing mon and dad on the farm. - Maybe we can help with the chores, Garfield. No way. - I'd get dizzy rotating the crops.
ga810923 -- I'm bored...bored, bored bored. Things could be worse I guess. - SPLOOT - Bingo.
ga810924 -- It's just my luck to fall into a hog waller. - Nothing is less appealing than a muddy cat. - Hello there, good lookin'. Oh shut up.
ga810925 -- How can you hogs stand to lie in a waller all day? - The mud keeps the flies off and keeps us cool. - And if we ever get out, the mud dries instantly.
ga810926 -- It's time to go home, Garfield. Let me knock that mud off you. - CRACK! - Thanks...I think.
ga810927 -- ROWR! - Aw, wadda matter? Did Puppy tat hurt his paw? Let me give it a kiss. - KISS - There we go. All better. - - Pooey! Where's the disinfectant?

ga810929 -- Where is it written I have to act like a cat?! - Why can't I act like a moose instead? - Stop being silly, Garfield. - Careful, fella. I've gored people for less than that.
ga810930 -- Hello, I'm a bluebird. - Garfield, you're too big to be acting this way. But I'm small for a sperm whale. - I'm thinking of getting you some professional psychiatric help. You mean there are AMATEUR psychiatrists?
ga811001 -- Doctor, I'm afraid my cat is having a nervous breakdown. - Z - Breakdown, maybe...nervous, no.
ga811002 -- I've psychoanalyzed your cat, Mr. Arbuckle... - He's just fine. Great! - It's good to know you're normal, Garfield. My friends call me moon unit.

ga811007 -- - RRRRR - I thought you asked me to dinner. Old habits are hard to break.
ga811008 -- I love those pointy little ears of yours and those luscious ruby red lips. - And I love listening to the melodic strains of the wind whistling through the gap between your front teeth. - You went one to far, fella. You're cute when you're
ga811008 -- angry.
ga811009 -- You know, Arlene, you are the second most beautiful cat I've ever met. - Who is she? - "Who is she?" she asks.

ga811015 -- Look, cat, you need a reason to be kept here and I need food. I'll show up infront of your owner and you chase me off. You'll have a job and I'll have a place to live. - Won't Jon get suspicious when I keep chasing the same mouse? - I'll wear
ga811015 -- different wigs. You thought of everything.

ga811017 -- Why don't we run out there and eat all the food? My owner won't let us. - Then let's kill him. - It is not wise to rub out the hand that feeds you. Can I nibble the toes out of his sweat socks?
ga811018 -- - You know, some foods are funnier than others. - Beets are funny. - Liver...not funny. - Prunes are funny, potatoes aren't. - Chicken, now, that's funny. - How about pickles and kumquats for lunch, Garfield? - WAH HA HA!

ga811216 -- How about a date, Liz? And what do you have in mind? - I'd love to just hold your hand and gaze into your eyes. - I like that. It's amazing the headway you can make when you stop playing games.
ga811217 -- Tonight I am going to take Liz out SOLO. You are staying home, Garfield. - Where's my favorite tie? - I get to go with you, and the tie lives. What say we double date, old buddy?
ga811218 -- Good evening, Liz. I have a wonderful time planned for us. - We'll have dinner, go to a movie, and many more things too numerous to mention. - You brought the cat. That was one of the unmentionables.

ga820106 -- Here's how to handle a fierce animal. - Show no fear. - And show no pain.
ga820107 -- If I'm quiet enough I should be able to prepare this lasagna all for myself. - Hark! Isn't that the sound of a lasagna noodle being laid on a bed of ricotta cheese? - Uncanny. Come on, come on. Bake that dude.

ga820121 -- Hey, Garfield, how are you going to get out of that tree! - Boing! Boing! - Why, by using my head...and Jon's, and Odie's.

ga820824 -- Rats...I can't shake this deep blue funk I'm in. - No doubt about it... - This week is gonna be one long Monday.
ga820825 -- Oh boy am I depressed. I'm fat, I'm lazy, nobody likes me... - Good morning, ol' buddy. It's another beautiful day. - Quiet. I'm on a roll.
ga820826 -- Nobody likes me. What's the matter with you, Garfield? - I SAID NOBODY LIKES ME! WHOCK! BONK! - Nobody likes me, and nobody listens anymore.
ga820827 -- I'm starting to lose my depression. I gotta do something. - - Much better.
ga820828 -- I love you, Garfield. Leave me alone. I want to be depressed. - Tickle! Tickle! Tickle! Hee hee - Feel better, Garfield? I'll get you for this, Jon.
ga820829 -- - It seems like I've been lost in this jungle for days with nothing to eat. - I'd eat berries, but there's no sugar and cream. - Where's a four-star french restaurant when you need one? - FOOD! - - Dr. Livingston, I presume.
ga820830 -- Look out, world! Here comes the caped avenger! - Oh, sure, super-hero crime fighters make for an old, overused story line... - But have you ever heard of a fat, weak one?
ga820831 -- The caped avenger steps into the seamy underworld and reasserts his noble code. - "I will seek out evil wherever it may lurk and destroy it". - Unless, of course, there is the slightest possibility of harm to my person.

ga820907 -- I resolve to stop being fat, lazy and cynical. I shall now rise at an early hour. - - Z
ga820908 -- As long as I'm improving myself this week, I might as well try to get along with Odie. - Come here, Odie. Give me a big hug. - Yuk.
ga820909 -- I shall now use sheer willpower to resist eating that hamburger. - Unnngh - WAH! I'm beginning to worry about Garfield.
ga820910 -- This self-improvement bit is beginning to bug me. I feel like a goody-two-shoes. - Maybe my old personality wasn't all that bad... - The gluttony, laziness and cynism lent a little texture.
ga820911 -- I'm sick of this self-improvement kick. - I'M FAT, I'M LAZY AND I'M CYNICAL! - I admire that in a cat.

ga820924 -- - -
ga820925 -- Look at all those tiny ants going to the tiny beach to do some swimming. - Uh-oh. A tiny minnow is cruising in to eat the swimmers. - Uh-oh. The minnow just got harpooned by an ant who bears a striking resemblance to Robert Shaw.
ga820926 -- WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! - WHAM! WHAM! I don't like the sound of this. - Surprise, Garfield! What have we here? - We now have two houses. A big one and this little one. A regular Taj Mahal. - One of us is going to live in the big house, and one of

ga820927 -- OH NO! IT'S NOT THERE! - I'm not getting out of bed without it! - Not without my morning cup of coffee!
ga820928 -- Good morning, Jon. - Well, helloooo there. Come to papa. - That's me, Jon Arbuckle, second fiddle to a coffee bean.
ga820929 -- Garfield, you'll never find happiness at the bottom of a coffee cup. - I beg to differ. - Look, there's some right there in the corner. By golly, you're right.
ga820930 -- Take it easy on that coffee, Garfield. - It might be too much for your tiny system. - Pardon me, boy, is that the chattanooga choo-choo Bingo.
ga821001 -- I love you, coffee; you make me glow. - You make me smile. I love you so. - My nerves don't like you, but what do they know?
ga821002 -- Now for a strong cup of coffee. - Now for a good night's sleep. - Now for a brisk bout with insomnia.
ga821003 -- What's that rumbling? The ground is shaking! - Oh, no! It's THEM! - THERE'S NO WAY OUT! I'M TRAPPED LIKE A RAT! - ARRRGH! -
ga821004 -- - ARRGH! - Very funny, Odie. Now get your face off the window.
ga821005 -- - - ROWR
ga821006 -- I got you a new friend, Garfield. He even talks. Oh, goody. - Will you play with me? Why, of course, little buddy. - Let's go play with Jon's power tools.
ga821007 -- I wonder what that bag of sawdust has to say. - Feed me. Feed me. Feed me. Feed me. Feed me. - He does have a certain charm.
ga821008 -- Imagine, the nerve of Jon giving me a dummy as companion. What kind of an intellectual dwarf does he think I am? - Practice of the Aristotelean mean would have a significant positive effect on the world institutional environment. - Oh, shut
ga821008 -- up.
ga821009 -- Your little friend here is certainly cute, Garfield. - stomp! stomp! stomp! - Little friend or not, there's something to be said for the diplomatic removal of competition.
ga821010 -- What's this? - Here's an interesting article about the ancient practice of cannibalism. Lovely. - Can you imagine what life was like then? - Traveling salesmen were called "meals on wheels". - Having the boss over for dinner had an entirely
ga821010 -- different meaning. - It says here certain tribal societies also ate cats. - I can hear a diner complaining, "oh, waiter, there's a flea collar in my soup". That's not funny.
ga821011 -- Maybe I wouldn't hate mondays so much if I didn't have this calendar here to remind me. - -
ga821012 -- That hamburger is mine, Garfield. It's mine. - Let's see if you want it after I stomp it, lick it and shed on it. - You win, Garfield. You can have it. I don't think I want it now.
ga821013 -- POP! POP! POP! POP! POP! POP! POP! - Let me guess. You're going tree climbing, right? - How did you know?
ga821014 -- Now to get out of this tree. - - Don't you dare! sniff sniff
ga821015 -- I wish you understood my every word, Garfield. - I could tell you I love you. I understand how you feel. - I love me, too.

ga821017 -- - - SMACK! - HEY! - tickle tickle tickle - STOP IT, GARFIELD! YOU PLAY TOO ROUGH! - I'm sorry I yelled at you, Garfield. Cats have feelings too, you know.
ga821018 -- I'm not leaving bed, I'm not moving a muscle. If I don't bother Monday, maybe Monday won't bother me. - Hello, I'm Nermal, the world's cutest kitten, here to visit for the week. - Well, maybe I will do just a teensy bit of sobbing.
ga821019 -- The mirror is one of cat's best friends, Nermal. You can primp in it, play with it and admire yourself in it. - - I don't see what's so great about it.
ga821020 -- Follow me, Nermal. This is how you climb a tree. - Now what do we do? What a silly question. - We sit here until the fire department comes.
ga821021 -- lick - LICK - What happened to you?
ga821022 -- How cute. Thank you, Nermal. - - Uh...thanks. You'd better appreciate it, sucker. Your flower garden gave its life for this bouquet.
ga821023 -- Tell me, Garfield, are you threatened by the fact that I am much younger and cuter than you are? I'm bigger than that. - You can say that again! - See how they like your rapier wit on the moon.
ga821024 -- Hello. - I wonder what kind of hat this is? - - What time's that there bus leaving for Topeka? - See you, mum. Billy Bob and me are gonna play in traffic. - Gee, I'd love to go to the cotillion but I gotta stay home and watch armwrestling on
ga821024 -- TV. - That's it. This must be one of those stupid hats.
ga821025 -- Get ready to go, Garfield. We are going to visit dad and mom on the farm. - Send my regrets. I really must stay home and pluck my nose hairs. - I guess I'm ready to go.

ga821028 -- I guess we'll have to stay in this abandoned house tonight, Garfield. - Garfield R.I.P. 6-19-78 10-30-82 - I can't put my finger on it, but I have an uneasy feeling about this place.
ga821029 -- This house is spooky, isn't it, Garfield? Kind of reminds me of the vet's office. - Uh-oh, footsteps! Quick! Into the closet! CLOMP CLOMP - What do you suppose it is? CLOMP CLOMP Let's hope it's the welcome wagon.
ga821030 -- CLOMP CLOMP It's coming to get us, Garfield. It knows we're in the closet!  -ARRGH! - DAD! You didn't show, so I came looking for you. One life down, eight to go.

ga821104 -- What's that, daddy? It's lasagna. And don't call me daddy. - Here. Have a piece. Yuk! - NO SON OF MINE WOULD REFUSE LASAGNA!
ga821105 -- Stop hanging around me, kid. Just remember, you're a tender young chicken and I'm a very hungry cat. - I guess I have that little giblet the what for. - EYOW!
ga821106 -- For the last time, kid, I'm not your daddy. You're a chicken and I'm a cat. - Now go back to your mother. Goodbye, daddy. -

ga821125 -- If I were to come back to this earth, I'd like to come back as a pillow. - I could lie in bed all day. - And people would put their heads in my lap and go to sleep.
ga821126 -- UH-OH! HERE COMES THAT MEAN DOG! - Nobody would ever harm a sleeping cat? - Wrongo.

ga821129 -- SNAP! SQUEAK! What's that? - Oh, no! Since I'm not a mouser, Jon set a mousetrap. Now it's killed a mouse! - If you did your job, I wouldn't be in this fix.
ga821130 -- I'm sorry you got caught in that mousetrap, mouse. Oh, that's okay. I have a wife and eight kids. - What doest that have to do with anything? - This is the first peace and quiet I've had in years.
ga821201 -- Have a piece of cheese, mouse. Maybe that will make you feel better. - - How am I supposed to swallow? Good point.
ga821202 -- You're free to go, mouse. Thanks. - Just where have you been? I suppose you and your fat friend have been having fun while I've been working and slaving taking care of our children. You'd better get yourself home right now. - SNAP!
ga821203 -- Now get out of here. - - SNAP! SQUEAK!
ga821204 -- - Jon will be checking this trap soon. - My bunny slippers? They like to roam at night.
ga821205 -- ALL RIGHT! - I love flowers! - I love to tiptoe through tulips. - Dive through daisies. - Romp through roses. - You cat broke 'em, you bought 'em, buddy. Put some pansies on the tab, too.
ga821206 -- Don't knock those flowers of the windowsill, Garfield. - I put them there to give them some sun. - And some fresh air.
ga821207 -- Windows are great. They offer a front row seat to life's passing parade. - THUD! - They are also good for a yuk or two.
ga821208 -- I see you're bringing the mail in with your usual care. - This letter says, "do not fold, spindle or mutilate." - It didn't say anything about "maul".
ga821209 -- - MY NEWSPAPER! YOU CHEWED UP MY NEWSPAPER! - It's things like this that make me wonder if you should bring in the paper at all. Precisely. poo
ga821210 -- On chilly mornings, this is my favorite place in the whole house. - - Over the heat vent.
ga821211 -- Garfield, did you eat fern? - WHY IS IT I GET BLAMED FOR EVERYTHING AROUND HERE? IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG, YOU JUST LAY It ON OL' GARFIELD! - I have no idea what you're talking about.
ga821212 -- - You can have this hamburger if you can reach it, Garfield. - WHA!? - - - b-b-b-b-b-b-b - Jon will rue the day I got these rubber arms.

ga821215 -- I think I'll step off my diet just long enough to eat a couple dozen cookies. - Lettuce? - That cat has no sense of humor.
ga821216 -- - - You know you're on a diet when even the dog food commercials look good.
ga821217 -- You may go off your diet as soon as you loose some weight, Garfield. Why didn't you say so sooner? - BUZZ - Let's eat.
ga821218 -- Heck with it. I'm going off my diet. - - Show me a dieter, and I'll show you a person who belittles himself.

ga821223 -- I hope this gift is mine. rattle rattle rattle - CRACK! tinkle tinkle tinkle - I hope it's Odie's.
ga821224 -- It's only noon, Garfield. Are you going to bed already? The sooner you go to bed, the sooner it's Christmas morning. - - Good night, little fella.
ga821225 -- Comics readers are very special people. You mean more to me than there is space here to express. - I love you all. - Have a happy holiday. I'll be funny again tomorrow, trust me.
ga821226 -- Set the stage, light the lights. - Good evening, ladies and germs. - SPLAT - My car is so old, it is insured against fire, theft and India raids. BLUT - My girlfriend is so cross-eyed, she can sit on the front porch and count the chickens in

ga830104 -- - I didn't know that you like to dance, Garfield. What are you talking about? - I was scratching my back with your toothbrush.
ga830105 -- Good morning, Odie. - Hey, get away from Jon's stamp collection! - Too late.
ga830106 -- What should do tonight? - SPLUT - Good idea. I think I'll go sing on the fence.
ga830107 -- OH, NO! FIRE ARROWS! THOCK - I'M A GONER! THOCK - A CAT ALWAYS GOES DOWN WITH HIS FENCE!
ga830108 -- I can't believe that tacky pack of music haters burned my fence down. - The only thing to do is to get right back up there and start singing again. - But...somehow it just isn't the same.
ga830109 -- Here he comes...tweedledee, the wonder dummy. - Hey, Odie, would you like to play ball? - - squeak - - tie tie - Hey, Garfield, where's Odie? He's tied up at the moment. dribble dribble dribble
ga830110 -- SLAM - Hey, Garfield. I'm home. - You're certainly excited to see me. Believe me, inside I'm hopping up and down and shouting with glee.
ga830111 -- So I say to this clerk, "Look, if the whole bunch of bananas is 54 cents, why can't I have one for 6 cents? - - Don't you want to hear how the story came out? Tell it to your plants.
ga830112 -- - - Garfield, you seem to be preoccupied this week. Huh?
ga830113 -- Garfield hasn't been listening to me lately, watch this. - Hey, Garfield, what say we go to the vet and get you declawed? - That would be fine. Case closed.
ga830114 -- I hate it when Garfield ignores me. - DARN IT! PAY SOME ATTENTION TO ME! - Z I think I'm going to cry.
ga830115 -- Jon, I know I've been ignoring you lately, but I want to say it's not because I don't care for you. - It's like my ears hear you, but my brain keeps straying off course. I've just been preoccupied. - Enough said. Let's get on with it. Huh?
ga830116 -- ZOO - Do Not Feed The Animals I wonder what it would be like to be a wild animal. - First, I'd alter this stupid sign. Feed the Animals - Then I'd pace around looking kinda fierce. - Then I'd scare the heck out of the crowd. - SWIPE EEEEK! -
ga830116 -- That was a pretty convincing performance, if I do say so myself.
ga830117 -- - - I love it when they entertain me.
ga830118 -- It appears Jon has prepared himself a very nice meal, but something is missing. What could it be? - Why, of course... - The cat hair!
ga830119 -- - - Okay, okay, I'll turn the heat up.
ga830120 -- This is my humble abode, my dear. - - Who were they? Oh, just a couple of animals I'm giving away soon.
ga830121 -- Garfield, sometimes I think you don't like it when I have dates. Absolutely. - Dating leads to marriage. Marriage leads to children. - And do you know what children do to cats?
ga830122 -- Hey, Jon, what's happening? - Eat your breakfast, Garfield. - Where's your sense of humor?
ga830123 -- * - Isn't that Halley's comet? - ZIP! - Garfield, did you take my steak? Who? Little ol' me? - Look, I don't have your crummy old steak. - HEY! I DON'T HAVE YOUR CRUMMY OLD STEAK! - I'm going to get you for this, Odie. Burp.

ga830125 -- Hey, Garfield, there's a lasagna under the bed! - - Thanks for dusting under the bed for me, Garfield. I hate you.
ga830126 -- - WHIRRR! - nightie-night, Jon. I hate you.
ga830127 -- Surprise, Garfield! I brought you another rubber mouse. Yippee skip. - By the way, what happened to your last one? It was tragic. - He was caught and eaten by a rubber cat.
ga830128 -- Surprise, Garfield! I threw your old bed in the trash and got you this new one. What do you think? - - Z
ga830129 -- Dogs have the world's stupidest toys. Just look at this rubber bone. - Simple minds, simple pleasures. - It certainly doesn't hold the scintillating intellectual challenge of my fuzzy scratching post wit the springy rubber mouse.
ga830130 -- * - - - - - ROWR! ARRRGH! - THAT WASN'T FUNNY; GARFIELD! Funny is in the eye of the beholder.
ga830131 -- plop! - EEEEEEK! - I'm almost afraid to ask what happened here.
ga830201 -- QUICK! QUICK! PUT POOKY'S ARM BACK ON! - Relax, Garfield. I'll fix Pooky right up. It's no big deal. - No big deal?! Look, buster. I've never lost a loved one before.
ga830202 -- - I sewed Pooky's arm back on as good as new, Garfield. - Yes, but will he ever play the piano again? Me thinks the cat doth expect too much.
ga830203 -- You did a pretty good job of sewing Pooky's arm on. - I used small stitches so as not no leave a scar. - I think he's picking on me.
ga830204 -- Pooky, when you lost your arm, I got to thinking about our mortality, and that's depressing. - So promise me you'll never lose your arm again, okay? -
ga830205 -- I wonder what my fortune cookie is. - Today you will be whisked away to a large white building where all you have to do is lie in bed all day as lots of people pay attention to you and bring you food. - That sounds too good to be true.
ga830206 -- - - I can stare anything down. - - - Uh, Garfield, fish can't blink. - Now he tells me...now that my eyeballs are all dried out?
ga830207 -- I wonder what awful thing is going to happen to me today? Maybe the sky will fall. Maybe Odie will bring his long lost twin brother home... - - Or worse yet, maybe Nermal will come for a visit.
ga830208 -- Oh sure, you're getting all the attention right now, Nermal, But when you grow up you'll be as unloved as I am. - I'm never growing up. Who are you? Peter Pan or something? - I'm a midget. Some cats get all the luck.
ga830209 -- If you want to be cute like me, you have to play wit a ball of yarn. That sounds simple enough. - Yours is over there. - I hate him
ga830210 -- Nermal, you're so sweet, why don't I just stuff you into this sugar bowl. - Go ahead and try it, fat boy. - Say, Garfield, Where's Nermal? At a humility lesson.
ga830211 -- You disgust me, Nermal. - You're a wide-eyed, mindless, little piece of fluff. You're so cute everyone loves you. - Eat your heart out, bozo. I am, I am.
ga830212 -- Unk. You've overstayed your welcome. - - Where's Nermal? You know...I was strange, he muttered "unk" and then left without a word.
ga830213 -- And just when I thought it was safe to go back in the kitchen. - Garfield, why don't you like to take baths? Bathing robs cats of precious natural oils that protect us from skin disease. - What do you know? Hop in there right now. Let me get
ga830213 -- my tubby toys. - Today, today. - - There now, don't you feel much better? Much.
ga830214 -- Are you sure you want to watch this, Garfield? - It's a depressing movie about a man-eating lion that terrorizes a native village. - You root for your side, I'll root for mine. Lion.
ga830215 -- I hate movies about man-eating lions. - How can an animal possibly prey on an innocent victim? - Explain that to the chicken you had for dinner.
ga830216 -- OH, NO! THE LION RAN DOWN ANOTHER VILLAGER! The original fast-food franchise. - Now what disgusting is the lion doing? - He's spitting the spear out.
ga830217 -- Tell me when the lion is finished eating the villager, okay, Garfield? You can look now. - EEEEEK! - He wasn't done yet! Oh, I thought you meant the MAIN parts.
ga830218 -- GOOD! They shot the lion! - What do you think of those apples, Garfield? Big deal. - At the gun it was villagers:1, lion:42.
ga830219 -- Well, what do you think of the man-eating lion movie? - - You know I hate that, Garfield.
ga830220 -- That ice should be good for some yuks. - Ice, one. Odie, nothing. - Watch this. - Air mail! - Have a nice trip, Jon! - OH NO! - MY TOMATO PASTE!
ga830221 -- Z - BARK! -
ga830222 -- - Oh, a heat vent. - The next best thing to my sunbeam.
ga830223 -- - Jogging is much more enjoyable if you have the proper motivation. - Ding Dong ICE CREAM
ga830224 -- I'd better save some of this blueberry pie for Jon. To eat it all would be inconsiderate and selfish. - - I am what I am.
ga830225 -- This is called a bird feeder, Garfield. - And this is called putting birdseed into the bird feeder. - He can call it what he likes. I call it baiting the trap.
ga830226 -- WOW! LOOK AT ALL THIS GOOD FOOD AND NEAT CLOTHING! - This is great stuff. - Stay out of the trash, Garfield. How did you know?
ga830227 -- Oboy! Jellybeans! - These green jellybeans are pretty tasty. - I don't care if they are Jon's favorite, I'm going to eat them all. - Why, hello there, Odie. - Here, you may have the last green jellybean. - Aren't I sweet? - My last green
ga830227 -- jellybean! I'm going to kill you, Odie! The plot thickens.
ga830228 -- I hate mondays. - Maybe if I tore mondays off the calendar there'd be no more mondays. RIP! -
ga830301 -- There must be an easier way to eat. - GO AHEAD AND START WITHOUT ME, BREAKFAST. - Burp...I should have thought of that long ago.
ga830302 -- What a unique perspective. Noe the ceiling is the floor and the floor is the ceiling. Hi, Garfield. - ZIP - Whatever goes down, must come up.
ga830303 -- I wonder whose glasses there are. - - Pablo Picasso's.
ga830304 -- I feel good today. I feel strong. - I feel invincible. I feel as tall as a skyscraper. - Get off there, King Kong. ayieeee
ga830305 -- * - Hop up here, Garfield. It's dinner time. - "hop up here," he says.
ga830306 -- I feel like a change of pace. - I think I'll move in slow-motion today. - Wha!? - - Oh, no, you don't. - - It's hard to take what you want in life when they see you coming.
ga830307 -- Uh-oh, there's a package for me. - I don't think I'm going to like it. - Beware of gifts bearing air holes.
ga830308 -- Gee, I hope this package doesn't have a bomb or a monster in it. - GASP! IT'S EVEN WORSE THAN MY MOST HIDEOUS FEARS! - It's another sweater for me from Jon's mother.
ga830309 -- - scratch scratch scratch scratch scratch - I hate wool sweaters.
ga830310 -- - There is one thing I like about this sweater. - Z
ga830311 -- - There's more than one way to skin a cat. - TWANG - Check that...CHOKE a cat.
ga830312 -- I hate designer sweaters. - Look at this. - The lizard chewed the armpit out of it.
ga830313 -- Doo-dee-doo-dee-doo PLOP - Garfield need a better balanced diet. So I'm disguising this liver as dessert. - Why, hello, Garfield. I fixed a yummy treat for you. - I call it "Sweet Surprise" - He'll be surprised, all right. - ARRGH! He ate it!
ga830313 -- He ate it! Surprise.
ga830314 -- Hey, Garfield, look at what I got at the barber shop. - Th-dah! What do you think? It's tacky, tasteless and disgusting. - It's you.
ga830315 -- Bingo! - Hook shot! - Ha-ha-ha, Garfield, ha-ha-ha-
ga830316 -- Jon sure looks dumb with this fake mustache. - Very few people can wear a mustache. - Like evil Roy Gato, for instance.
ga830317 -- Nyah, nyah, nyaaah, evil Roy Gato does his daily dirty deed. - push - - The mustache made me do it.
ga830318 -- Oh, there you are, Garfield. - Let me guess...you stole my fake mustache and ate my spaghetti, right? - How'd you guess?
ga830319 -- Give me a kiss, sweetheart. - KISS - How do you tell a lady her mustache needs more wax?
ga830320 -- This looks like a good spot to rest. I never saw a spot that wasn't a good spot to rest. - Well, Garfield, here we are in the great outdoors. It's outdoors, all right, but I'd debate the "great". - Just listen to the sounds of nature. Sounds
ga830320 -- like noise to me. - Nature can actually speak to you, you know. Go on.  Hear that? Nature is speaking to you now. Wait, I do hear something... - I HEAR IT! I HEAR IT! - Nature is saying, "Garfield the cat, you're a long way from your warm bed
ga830320 -- and television set."
ga830321 -- COME ON, MONDAY! DO IT TO ME NOW! THE SUSPENSE IS KILLING ME! - THOCK - Thank you for your prompt consideration.
ga830322 -- Did I ever tell you about my uncle Nick? He loves to destroy things. He can shred a recliner in 12 seconds... - Mangle ferns by the carload and turn a set of china into powder in the blink of an eye. - He is presently a postal employee in
ga830322 -- Chicago.
ga830323 -- - Nice try, Garfield, but I don't buy your stupid watermelon disguise. - RATA TATTA TATTA TATA
ga830324 -- - Don't make fun of Odie, Garfield. That's not nice. - That's even less nice.
ga830325 -- Come and get it, Garfield. - CRASH! - Your not a sailplane, you know. Oh, shut up.
ga830326 -- Dinnertime, Garfield! - BANZAI -
ga830327 -- * I hate dogs and dogs hate me, I chase the tiny ones, the big ones chase me. - Do Not Open This Gate! Hello, what's this? - That's an open invitation if I ever saw one. - Of course, it may not be wise to open the gate. - But that never
ga830327 -- stopped me before. I'll just take a little peek. - - Curiosity mangled the cat.
ga830328 -- PUNT - This is turning out to be a decent Monday for a change. - POOMP!
ga830329 -- gobble gobble gobble - Garfield, you eat too fast. No, I don't. - I'm just overqualified for the job.
ga830330 -- Garfield will never reach this pie up here. - CHINK - And just where are you going? For my morning scale?
ga830331 -- ARRRRGH! - What a horrible nightmare! I dreamt I was a dog. - Thank goodness it was only a dream. scratch scratch scratch
ga830401 -- No more of this sniveling sissy stuff. - I'm getting out of this tree like a man. - On the other hand, sniveling does have its attributes.
ga830402 -- I gotta get out of this tree. - Oh well, they tell me a cat always lands on his feet. - However, THEY failed to mention the pain.
ga830403 -- - - - - - - We must have lunch sometime. Things aren't always as they seem.
ga830404 -- Hey, Garfield, let's take a vacation. - We'll go someplace tropical. - Save your money. Go sit in your aquarium.
ga830405 -- Vacation is going to be so great, Garfield. - We'll get away from this rat race. There'll be no hassles. - A change of pace would be nice.
ga830406 -- Hey, Garfield, what do you think of this shirt for our vacation? - Tah-dah! That's awful. - Do you know how many turkeys were destroyed to make that shirt?
ga830407 -- Good news, Garfield! The airline has a special allowing children to fly free. So? - So when you leave on vacation, you can pose as my son and ride up front. I will not demean myself by dressing up as some stupid kid. - Otherwise, you'll have
ga830407 -- to ride  in a kitty carrier in the baggage compartment. DADDY!
ga830408 -- I hope you don't mind flying, Garfield. - Some animals don't travel well. Nonsense. - If a dog can be a World War I flying ace, I can surely fly commercial.
ga830409 -- Just bear in mind, Garfield, even though we're leaving on vacation... - And even though we're going to have fun... - It's always nice to get back home.
ga830410 -- This is going to be fun, Garfield. Ha ha ha, wheee. - I think you'll like flying. I'd like it if I could keep one paw on the ground. - Oooooh, I think I'm getting airsick. - What's that? It sounds like a wing cable fraying! - I SMELL SMOKE!
ga830410 -- sniff sniff - WE'RE GOING DOWN IN FLAMES! - We're still on the ground, Garfield. GREAT! CATS AND CHILDREN FIRST!
ga830411 -- Tell me, Garfield. - Are you nervous about flying? - I take no chances.
ga830412 -- I think you'll enjoy flying, Garfield. - It's a very comfortable and smooth way to travel. - Then what are these little bags for? The easter egg hunt?
ga830413 -- No pets allowed. This is my son. He has a body hair problem. - How old are you, sonny? Rowr. - That's baby talk for "one going on two".
ga830414 -- crunch crunch - What do you think of airline meals, Garfield? GULP - The only thing with food content was the plastic fork I just ate.
ga830415 -- - - The captain has advised that the "Fasten Seat Belt" sign be observed in case some slight air turbulence is encountered.
ga830416 -- Well, Garfield, how did you like your first airplane ride? Aside from the nausea, cramps and indigestion, I'm fine. - Have a nice day. HAVE A NICE DAY?! - LET HER LIVE, GARFIELD! LET HER LIVE!
ga830417 -- Ah, this is the life, isn't it, Garfield? - For real relaxation, it's hard to beat the tropics. Oh, go sit on a sandburg. - You should go play in the surf, Garfield. Maybe next year. - There are fish out there, you know. Well, why didn't you
ga830417 -- say so?! Ha ha ha. - Simple cat, simple pleasures.
ga830418 -- Do you know what I love about the tropics, Garfield? I have a feeling you're going to tell me. - It's the miles and miles of sparkling beach. - It may be a beach to you, but it's just a sandbox to me.
ga830419 -- There's one thing I love about the tropics. grrrr - FLIP! - The tiny dogs.
ga830420 -- You don't seem to be having a good time, Garfield. A keen observation. - What's the problem? I tell you what you do. - Find the biggest, heaviest fur coat you can and put it on. Then go lie in the blazing sun for a few hours and see how many
ga830420 -- youks you have.
ga830421 -- Tell me, my little wahine, what do you do? I'll bet you walk along the beach all day, then go home to your little thatched hut at night, right? - I'm a computer programmer from Cleveland. - Close. How about a date? He didn't even blink.
ga830422 -- This is the life, isn't it, Garfield? More fun than a cat should have. - Nothing to do but lie here in the sun. Listening to your brain bake. - Are you bored, Garfield? Is there sand in your swimsuit?
ga830423 -- This is going to upset you, Garfield... - Because I know you've had a great time. - But it's time we think about going home.
ga830424 -- La la la - There's nothing like a bubble bath to cure what ails you, Garfield. - pop pop - - - POW! Hey, Jon, what happened to you guys? You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
ga830425 -- Dear Garfield, what is your favorite all-time film? - It's "Old Yeller". - I love movies with happy endings.
ga830426 -- - - And just what do you think you're doing? Asserting my cathood?
ga830427 -- Garfield, why is it cats like to get out at night? - That's when we like to sing on fences. - In the daylight, we'd be easy targets.
ga830428 -- Today is thursday, and that's lasagna day. - Here's your cat food, Garfield. Will there be anything else? - Let me jog your memory.
ga830429 -- Why do you have such large teeth, Garfield? - All the better to eat you with, my dear. - Stop that! Obviously, sir, you are not a patron of the classics.
ga830430 -- I saw an awful movie last night called "Alien Dog." It was about this gigantic mutt that terrorized the world. - However, they did dispatch him with a rather clever ploy. - They electrified a 12-story fire hydrant.
ga830501 -- This looks like a good day for some heavy thoughts. - Let's put this whole thing in perspective. - Eating is important. - And sleeping is important. - But nothing is more important than holding someone you love. - Check that. - Reciprocation
ga830501 -- is nice, too.
ga830502 -- You're too fat, Garfield. Hang it in your ear. - Oh, shut up, Odie. - Why do I have the feeling there's a conspiracy afoot?
ga830503 -- * - ARRRGH! - It's diet week. It's diet week.
ga830504 -- - I gotta get off this diet. - It's starting to mess with my mind.
ga830505 -- - - Release my hand, Garfield. - You release hamburger, I release hand.
ga830506 -- Suicide, exercise and dieting. - RIP! - Name three forms of self-abuse. True...how true.
ga830507 -- - -
ga830508 -- * - - Oh, no! My watch has stopped! - I've missed Garfield's mealtime. - Pets have a way of letting you know when you've missed their mealtime. - You're late. I know, I know.
ga830509 -- Tell me, Garfield, when you walk, do your right and left legs travel together, or do you use your opposing legs? - - I'll never walk again.
ga830510 -- Z Z Z I wonder how birds can sleep in trees without falling out. - Z Z Z - Z Z Z Aha! ...hammocks.
ga830511 -- This is the only way to spend a sunny afternoon. - All you need is a swimming pool. - And a good imagination.
ga830512 -- I'm going to take a dip in here, so beat it, bird, before I break your beak. - - I have a mouth with a death wish.
ga830513 -- Take my advice. Sun yourself in a pool. You stay cooler that way. - I shall now turn over in order to tan my back. - This is not well thought out.
ga830514 -- As much as I hate to do it... - I'd better get out. - Even my fur is getting wrinkled.
ga830515 -- Look at those stupid dogs. - Yabba yabba yabba. - ROWF! BARK! BARK! - BARK! YIP! BARK! - Go away, dogs. Leave my cat alone. - bbbbbb - You just had to get in the last lick, didn't you, Garfield? Me and my big tongue.
ga830516 -- Hey, Garfield, guess what! We're going to visit dad and mom on the farm this week. - We'll eat some of mom's down-home cooking and help dad with the farm work. - Good thinking, Jon. Let's drive all the way to the sticks and fetch us an apple
ga830516 -- pie and a hernia.
ga830517 -- Your brother, Doc, has come back to work on the farm. He's here now. - Doc boy! Don't call me "Doc boy". - Jon boy! Mom boy! Doc boy! How are you? Oh boy.
ga830518 -- What brings you to the farm, Jon? I promised Garfield some good home cooking. - What would you boys like for breakfast? - My guess is Garfield would like some ham and eggs.
ga830519 -- Doc, you're looking more like dad all the time. - You take that back! - SMACK! Hush up, boy. The three stooges live.
ga830520 -- You know, Doc, for brothers, we don't look much alike. - It's hard to believe we came from the same place. - You mean, the farm? The funny farm maybe.
ga830521 -- Take care now. See you soon. Don't be a stranger. - So long! Bye bye! Bye now. Se yuh. - I can't believe the fuss they make over going to bed. You have a very close family.
ga830522 -- skitter skitter skitter - That's odd...two little bugs in full Shakespearean dress. - Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou, Romeo? I'm right here, Juliet. I bring bad news, Julie baby. Our families are feuding and don't want us to date anymore.
ga830522 -- Oh no! - That does it! Let's die in each other's arms and live together in eternity. How do we do that? - Here's how. squash - I'm not one to fool with great literature.
ga830523 -- Here comes Arlene. She's crazy about me. - Hi, Arlene. Hi, bozo. - I'm sure she meant to say, "Hunk".
ga830524 -- Let's go mousing. What's wrong with lasagna? - There's no thrill of pursuit. - Obviously, you've never snatched one off the table during sundae dinner.
ga830525 -- Why do girls always so good, Arlene? - We wear perfume. - Sounds kind of sissified to me. - I get this from a sex that likes to tattoo themselves.
ga830526 -- What does the moon remind you of, Garfield? - The moon reminds me of night, and that reminds me of sleep, which reminds me of breakfast... - That wasn't what I had in mind. Then, after breakfast, comes my nap...
ga830527 -- I'm taking you to a great restaurant tonight, Arlene. - bonk bonk Look, galvanized, not one of those cheap plastic places. - Now I've seen it all...a three-star garbage can.
ga830528 -- I'll see you, Arlene. It is customary, in human circles, to kiss a lady's hand. - You're not a human, and that's not a hand. That's a hairy paw. - Oil and water, nitro and glycerin, chivalry and realism.
ga830529 -- - I have a new plant in here, Garfield. Yum yum. - And I don't want you messing with it, okay? Sure. - - First I think I'll eat its tender little leaves, then I'll pick my teeth with its stems, followed by stomping the rest of the plant out
ga830529 -- of existence. - Prepare to die! - How did you like my cactus, Garfield? Prepare to die.
ga830530 -- I'm going out to a very nice restaurant tonight, Garfield. So you be good while I'm gone. - And, no, you can't come with me. - Who said I wanted to go to your crummy restaurant, anyway?
ga830531 -- Jon is going out without us tonight, Odie. - So you know what to do... - You chew his slippers and I'll destroy his chair.
ga830601 -- GARFIELD! LOOK WHAT YOU DID TO MY CHAIR! - I DON'T DESERVE THIS! - I was only gone for the evening. Now I know the face. Weren't you a former owner of mine?
ga830602 -- Garfield, I know being a cat owner is a big responsibility. - BUT I SHOULD Be ABLE TO LEAVE FOR AN EVENING WITHOUT YOU DESTROYING EVERYTHING! - I WANT A DIVORCE! I get half of everything.
ga830603 -- - squirt - OKAY! WHO GREASED MY WIENER?
ga830604 -- Hey, Garfield, What do you think of the new turtleneck sweater mom made you? - You're right. - It isn't very flattering, is it?
ga830605 -- I'm in a "what if" mood today. - I wonder what would happen if I married Arlene. - We'd have a huge wedding... - Then we'd raise some kittens... - And they'd crawl all over me. - Forget it! I'd make a lousy father.
ga830606 -- Garfield, it's noon. Are you getting out of bed? - I'd love to get up... - But the blanket is extra heavy today.
ga830607 -- - Think about a big, juicy bone, Odie. -
ga830608 -- Z - Z - Z
ga830609 -- Garfield, meet my new pet frog, "Herbie". - Isn't he great? Yeh, good ol' "Herbie". - Good ol' "your days are numbered as soon as Jon turns his back, Herbie".
ga860610 -- zzzzzzzz - Hey, Garfield, when was the last time you saw my pet frog, Herbie? zzzzz - SNAK! At lunch.
ga830611 -- It seems like an age since I gave Odie a boot. - BOOT! - I'm just a sentimental fool.
ga830612 -- Something's wrong. - Hey, Garfield! Let's have some fun! forget it, Jon. - I want to take you to an Italian restaurant for a lasagna dinner. No way. - They have ferns for dessert. Big deal. - Then we can come home and I'll hold Odie down
ga830612 -- while you beat him up. Try and make me. - - How did you know we have an appointment at the vet's? I don't know. I just know.
ga830613 -- In this box, I have a singing and dancing mouse. I have spent four years training him. He will now entertain you. - - I guess I should have cut air holes in the box.
ga830614 -- It's hard to believe I'm going to be five years old this sundae. - Shucks, golly, gee-whiz, ratso. - I'm going to have to start watching my language.
ga830615 -- Garfield, I hope the sun shines on your birthday. - What a nice thing to say. - I'm going camping. I didn't need that.
ga830616 -- - Mother nature has certainly been kind to you, Garfield. - I wish I could say the same for father time.
ga830617 -- They say the first thing to go on a cat is its hearing. - - Or was that eyesight?
ga830618 -- Your birthday gift is inside the card, Garfield. - Someday, my signature will be worth a lot of money! -
ga830619 -- sssh - This is the perfect surprise. It's much too early for Garfield to be up. - He's a year older today, you know. - SURPRISE! - -And a year sneakier.
ga830620 -- BARK! - FUMP! - Amoeba Man strikes again.
ga830621 -- Amoeba Man goes in search of food. - BONK! - Amoeba man should probably cut eyeholes in his exoskeleton.
ga830622 -- Amoeba Man spies food, but Amoeba Man has no mouth. - munch munch - A wonderful thing, osmosis.
ga830623 -- Ooooh. - Amoeba Man should not have eaten that hamburger so fast. - I have a nucleus ache.
ga830624 -- Amoeba Man stops to admire himself in the mirror. - - Face it, fells. you're one good-looking hunk of protoplasm.
ga830625 -- - Amoeba Man falls in love. - If I may be so bold, you have a great-looking pseudo pod, my dear.
ga830626 -- Hello. - You can tell a lot about their family from their garbage. - They have an infant who just outgrew its baby clothes. - The father recently gave up golfing. - And the mother cooks lots of pasta. - - Adopt me!
ga830627 -- Garfield, I know you're in my fern. I can see your tail. - What do you have to say for yourself? - Dr. Livingstone, I presume.
ga830628 -- Slow down there, ace. - Slow down, in deed. - Jon doesn't realize how much I have to eat to maintain my figure.
ga830629 -- Bark! Bark! Bark! - Garfield, get out of the cookie tin. - WHANG!
ga830630 -- - -
ga830701 -- Garfield! You ate my raisin cookies! - I thought you didn't like raisins. - I don't.
ga830702 -- Shoo! Shoo! Go away! I don't like you. - SLURP! - I hate blind devotion.
ga830703 -- How about a manly game of arm-wrestling, Garfield? You're on. - Are you ready, you furry sissy? Ready when you are, wimp. - - Unnngh Rrrr - What say we call it a draw, Garfield? I'll let you off the hook this time. - I'll see you, Garfield. So
ga830703 -- long, Jon. - Speak to me, arm! I'll never ruse this arm as long as I live.
ga830704 -- Garfield! I know you're in my fern. I can see your tail. - What do you have to say for yourself? - I say we attack the fort at dawn.
ga830705 -- I wonder what this is. - - Ah, a booby trap.
ga830706 -- - -
ga830707 -- - There you have it... - Odie's so stupid, he doesn't even understand the law of gravity.
ga830708 -- They say hammocks are very relaxing. - - Big deal.
ga830709 -- - -
ga830710 -- - What do you think of my Ming vase, Garfield? - CRASH! - Min, Shming, they don't make'm like they used to. - WHA!... GUH!... I DON'T!... BUH!... YOU!... YOU! - YOU DUMB ANIMAL! YOU'RE SO STUPID, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DID! - I know I
ga830710 -- - destroyed a priceless Ming dynasty vase as an overt expression to communicate my contempt for the politically oppressive doctrines of their early 17th century administration.
ga830711 -- I could sure use some of Jon's deodorant. - ssst - How's it going, Garfield? fine, until I found the spray starch in your cabinet.
ga830712 -- Go fetch the paper, will you, Garfield? That's what i live for. - Here you are, sahib. - Hey! This paper is all chewed up! Sahib asks fish, paper is wet. Sahib asks cat, paper is holey.
ga830713 -- - - WAH-HA HA-HA! I hate it when they do that.
ga830714 -- - slup slup slup - Drool fuel.
ga830715 -- Aw...how sweet. - Wait a minute! I'll bet you want something from me, don't you? - How dare you suggest I trade my affection for selfish reasons! For a bite of that hamburger, I'll forget you said that.
ga830716 -- Garfield, I know you're in my fern. I can see your tail. - What do you have to say for yourself? - Arf?
ga830717 -- * - - - - I am about to outdo myself. - WHAP!
ga830718 -- Garfield, I know you're in my fern. I can see your tail. - What do you have to say for yourself? - Pardon me, sir. Have you seen a tail here around?
ga830719 -- You don't like me, do you? I like you. - No, you don't. I'm crazy about you. I love you. - Now why don't you go play in the blender? SEE?
ga830720 -- Why don't you like me? You're young and you're cute. - If I were old and ugly, would you like me? Possibly. - This must be one of the things cats do when they think there are no humans around. Where's my cane? Where's my cane?
ga830721 -- I hate to do this. - I don't know how I'll get out of this tree. - But at least I'll be away from Nermal.
ga830722 -- What are you doing up here? Did you come to save me? - No, I just came to visit. - Well, talk fast. I was just considering leaping to my death.
ga830723 -- How do we get out of this tree? We jump. - If that little twerp can jump, so can I. -
ga830724 -- Z - Rise and shine. - Time to get up, Jon. - I'm hungry. - This ought to wake him up. - Jon must really be socked out. - I wasn't about to give him the satisfaction.
ga830725 -- Garfield, I know you're in my fern. I can see your tail. - What do you have to say for yourself? - You'll have to speak up. I can't hear you over the band.
ga830726 -- - Gee...uh, thanks, Odie. clunk! - What is it, Garfield? I'd wager it would have been easier to recognize before it wandered into traffic.
ga830727 -- Here comes Odie. His bark is worse than his bite. Bark! Bark! - BARK! - And his breath is worse than his bark.
ga830728 -- - SPLAT! - Spaghetti can turn on you when it's wounded.
ga830729 -- Oh, boy! I love to sluck spaghetti! - SLUCK! - Sorry about that.
ga830730 -- SLUCK - There's only one irritating thing about slucking spaghetti... - The whiplash.
ga830731 -- Hey, Garfield. - I have a big date with Liz tonight. What do you think about my outfit? - Mmmph - Hee hee hee - I don't have to take this. WAH-HA-HA-HA! - No cat's going to make a fool out of me.
ga830801 -- Garfield, I know you're in my fern. I can see your tail. - What do you have to say for yourself? - If you must know, I am a rare carnivorous fern, and if you don't mind, I'd like to finish eating your cat in peace.
ga830802 -- - HA-HA! YOU DIDN'T GET MY FOOD THAT TIME! - SPLAT
ga830803 -- - - You've been reading "Alice in Wonderland" again, haven't you? You must be psychic.
ga830804 -- RRR - RRR!!!!! - I want to know why you did that, Garfield! That's not half as interesting as how I got up there to begin with.
ga830805 -- Garfield, I want you to get all the mice out of this house, right now! Oh, very well. - Be a good boy and call my attorney, will you? - And have him serve them with an eviction notice.
ga830806 -- - ARRRGH!!! B-B-B-B! - Cats are so unpredictable. Predictably so.
ga830807 -- CATCH THAT MOUSE! - Garfield, why don't you eat mice like other cats? I don't like to hurt mice. How can I get that through your thick skull? - * - Dear Jon: The mice and I have an agreement. They don't bug me and I don't bug them. Therefore,
ga830807 -- I will never hurt mice...signed, GARFI* - GARFI*************** tick! tick! tick! The key must be stuck. - WHAM AAAWK! - Sorry about that, fella.
ga830808 -- - OH, NO! - My legs re shrinking!
ga830809 -- I've really done it this time. My belly has outgrown my legs. - I guess there's only one thing to do... - Get fitted for stilts.
ga830810 -- * Hummm *  - Oh, no! - You know you're overweight when you're sitting around rocking, and you realize you don't have a rocking chair.
ga830811 -- Garfield, you're getting dangerously overweight. - How dangerous can a little extra fat be? - Who, blub, would, blub, have, blub, guessed?
ga830812 -- Don't worry about your condition, Garfield. - You can still lead a useful and productive life. - As a paperweight, a doorstop, a... Put your face closer to thee claws.
ga830813 -- Rats! The dog next door! - Ever had a nightmare come true?
ga830814 -- * Hi, hi, Daisy-Waisy. Would you wike some wa-wa? Oh boysy-woysy. - If you speak nicely to plants, they grow better, Garfield. Bologna. - - - DIE! - Live and learn.
ga830815 -- - RIIIP! - Cruelty is second nature to that cat.
ga830816 -- - - Diet time. Rats.
ga830817 -- Happy diet, Garfield. Here's a banana for breakfast. - - Bang!
ga830818 -- As long as you're dieting, Garfield, why don't you exercise, too? - Sure...why not? - As long as the noose is around my neck, I might as well jump off the horse.
ga830819 -- Sticking to your diet, Garfield? Yup. - FUMP - But I did eat the pictures out of your cookbook.
ga830820 -- You're looking slim there, Garfield. Thanks. - I couldn't find a corset. - So I borrowed one of Jon's tube socks.
ga830821 -- - - - - - They say we can visit him 2 to 4 on saturday. Food gone! Food all gone!
ga830822 -- I can't possibly eat all this food. It's time for a...FOOD FIGHT! - SPLUT! - You stay out of this, Monday.
ga830823 -- Hallo, folks. How do you do? I'm Garfield, the cat. I'll entertain you. - SPLAT! - You stay out of this, mom.
ga830824 -- I just flew in from Pittsburgh and, boy, are my arms tired. - - The guy on the hook must be asleep.
ga830825 -- I gotta sing! I gotta dance! - BAP! BOP! BIFF! - I gotta be crazy.
ga830826 -- Goody, Jon's not around. - Jon stifles my lifestyle. - Put the dog down! He's no fun.
ga830827 -- - ZIP! - I don't know how we does it, we jus' does it.
ga830828 -- - splut - plik - bat - scratch-  drip - Bored, Garfield? Some days I get tired of being a cat.
ga830829 -- - - That wasn't very nice, Garfield. - In this business, "nice! doesn't put bread on the table.
ga830830 -- Why is it I'm crazy about you, Garfield? Probably because I'm perfect. - You claw the drapes, shed on the furniture, steal my food and hassle the dog. - Nobody's perfect.
ga830831 -- Garfield's in for a surprise. I put an alarm on the refrigerator. - That's the first rule for successfully living with a cat. - You must be smarter than the cat.
ga830901 -- Given the choice, Garfield, would you rather be rich or famous? - You're talking to a cat here, fella. All I need is a warm lap, some good food and a little attention. - I guess a cat wouldn't care about either. I'd rather be rich.
ga830902 -- - - Any last words, Garfield? How about "Gotcha"?
ga830903 -- Here's some salad and dressing, Garfield. You may mix them to your taste. - gluk gluk gluk - How was it? Could've use more dressing.
ga830904 -- Fire Destroys House - It's time you boys learn where the fire exit is. - In case of fire, go straight to your swinging pet door, got that? - I'd better give them a little test. - FIRE! - Clever me.
ga830905 -- Jon must be cleaning the heating grate. I wonder what grates are for, anyway. - OOPS! - Obviously, they're to keep one's house from eating one's cat.
ga830906 -- Silly me had to fall into the heating vent. Now here I am, residing deep within the bowels of my house. - Forced to spend my remaining days fending for myself in the tin tunnels of the duct work, the solenoid jungle of the wiring system and
ga830906 -- the polyvinyl chloride playground in the crawl space. - Hey! I think there's a book here somewhere.
ga830907 -- Meyow! - GARFIELD! WHERE ARE YOU? I'm in the plumbing. - WHAT CAN I DO? Just don't flush the toilet.
ga830908 -- Hey, Odie! I'm trapped in the heating vent. Help me out! - A hacksaw-great! -
ga830909 -- - Unnngh - Garfield...where are you? Down here in the floor's joists, plotting your untimely demise.
ga830910 -- Free at last! - There is something to be said for brute force. - It is usually followed by brute stupidity.
ga830911 -- Z - BARK! - grrrr - slurp! - Z - ZIP! - You can growl in my face, you can lick my head, but if you touch my food, consider yourself dead.
ga830912 -- Whew, not much room left. - I'll have to decide between the blueberries or cheese for dessert. - I hear the blueberries are lovely this time of year.
ga830913 -- Why haven't I ever seen talking food before? Because you're as dumb as your look. - Oh, yeah? Touche. - I can't believe I'm talking to a cheese.
ga830914 -- I wish I were a cat instead of a mouse. - Never be ashamed of what you are. We must all accept our plight in life and make the best of it. - You're not on the business end of the food chain. Good point.
ga830915 -- I have a confession to make. - My mother was a lemming. What's a lemming? - A gerbil with suicidal tendencies. My condolences.
ga830916 -- So you're half lemming. Yes, my mother always had the urge to cast herself off a cliff into the sea. - AWK! - Darn you, mom.
ga830917 -- What the heck are you doing? - I'm half lemming, you know. So? - I'm getting back to my roots. I had to ask.
ga830918 -- - If you eat this pie, I'm going to kill you. - - - - GARFIELD! YOU ATE MY PIE! - One of the great criminal minds of your time, I ain't.
ga830919 -- - Rats. - I used up my eating energy on the getting here.
ga830920 -- I'm tired of being out of shape. - I can't catch Odie. I can't catch my breath. - Heck, I can't even catch my lunch.
ga830921 -- I really don't like myself when I'm out of shape and overweight. - Well, this time I'm going to do something about it! - I'm going to lower my expectations!
ga830922 -- Come on, Jon! Up and at'em! - There's a fresh new day out there. Are you going to join me, or are you going to lie there and wither away? - There's nothing worse than a born-again jogger.
ga830923 -- hop hop hop - hop - Leg warmers.
ga830924 -- Get on your mark, get set... - Jog! - The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
ga830925 -- It's going to be a scorcher today. - The sidewalk is already hot. - OOCH! EECH! OUCH! - Oog! Argg! Ick! - Garfield! What are you doing on this hot sidewalk? - Why don't we go inside? - What? And disappoint my public? CLINK
ga830926 -- I'm not one to brag on my teddy bear, but you are not going to believe this. - Okay, Pooky, pay attention now. Are you ready? - Play dead!
ga830927 -- I'm getting too old to have a teddy bear. - It's not that I feel silly... - It's the peer pressure.
ga830928 -- Pooky, I have to start weaning myself from you. I gotta make it out there on my own. - - That's good enough for the first week.
ga830929 -- I have to break this teddy bear dependency. - -
ga830930 -- I've made it a whole day without my teddy bear, but if I don't cuddle something soon, I'll go crazy. - - This sweat sock just isn't the same.
ga831001 -- POOKY! - So much for kicking the teddy bear habit. - It's unnatural to be near someone you love and not hold them now and then.
ga831002 -- I don't believe my eyes! - I've finally found the perfect skipping stone! The perfect weight, perfectly round and flat, everything. - But there are no lakes around here, and it's too far to the river. - Darn it! I've got this stone begging to
ga831002 -- be skipped and no place to skip it! - * - KONG! - Hey, look! The perfect skipping stone!
ga831003 -- I hate it when Odie gets caught outside in the rain. - Not that I care that much for Odie, mind you. -
ga831004 -- - Here's one of the great mysteries of the universe... - When Odie closes his mouth, where does his tongue go?
ga831005 -- I wanted to buy you another bed, Garfield. But the only sizes they came in were small, medium and large. - They didn't have showboat! - A quick wit is best accompanied by quick reflexes.
ga831006 -- I love a well-balanced meal. - Something from the four basic food groups... - Meat, vegetable, dairy and catsup.
ga831007 -- Garfield should be finding that rubber hot dog in his bowl right about now. - And he should be coming for me right about... - Now.
ga831008 -- I think I'll have pancakes for breakfast. - - Once again our nation's criminal element has callously disregarded the truth in packaging laws.
ga831009 -- Ho with a capital hum. - I wish I could kick this industrial-strength depression I have today. - - - - - Mother nature, if you had a body and a face, I'd give you a hug and a kiss.
ga831010 -- Here comes Arlene. She's crazy about me. - Hi, Arlene. - I said..."Hi, Arlene".
ga831011 -- Hey, Arlene. Guess how much weight I can press. - I'll bet you don't know. I'll bet I don't care. - Right now I'd trade all this strength for just one snappy comeback.
ga831012 -- Hey, Arlene. Look at this. So what? - Just what does it take to impress you, lady? A challenge to my head as well as my heart. - As soon as she regains consciousness, I'll challenge the heart part.
ga831013 -- It's my dinnertime, Arlene. But don't despair, I'll be right back. The moments will seem like years till you return. - I don't know how she does it... - How one well-turned phrase from that woman can suck all the wind out of your sails.
ga831014 -- Arlene, I'm sick of the witmatching mood you're in. - Okay, I'll stop it. There's no battle of the intellects here anyway. - You're right. It was kind of like swatting a fly with a buick.
ga831015 -- How about a kiss, Arlene? What kind of animal are you? - A cat! - AUUGH! I did it! I did it! She said, "what kind of animal are you?" and I said, "a cat!"
ga831016 -- Isn't that pathetic? - Odie, all you ever do is stare and slobber. - You're too happy, and that's not healthy. - People don't trust a chronically happy person. - Who could possibly love a grinning idiot like this? - - YOU STAY OUT OF THIS!
ga831017 -- Oh, boy, am I down today. - You look down today, Garfield. But I think I'm even downer. - I hate one-downmanship.
ga831018 -- I am down...down, down, down, down, down. - Down, down, down, dooby doo down, down. - Comma, comma, down dooby doo down, down.
ga831019 -- I'm so depressed it's depressing. Tell me about it. - I think I'll go out and shoot myself. Sure. - You're just trying to cheer me up.
ga831020 -- Why are we so depressed, Garfield? I have this theory. - We've been staying up too late, lately. - And being happy takes entirely too much energy.
ga831021 -- We've gotta do something about this depression, Garfield. Check. - Maybe a change of surroundings would cheer us up. Check. - Wrongo. Check
ga831022 -- There's only one way out of this deep blue funk we're in, Garfield. I hate to do it, but it has to be done. I hope it works. - Ooch! Eech! - Tah-dah! Bingo!
ga831023 -- - click HEY! - click I was watching "Cheerleader High!. - click Well, I'm watching "Wonder Cat"! - rip - CRASH - I was much more passive before I became a wonder cat cadet.
ga831024 -- Hello, folks. I'm here to entertain you! Are you glad to see me? ---well, are you? - Okay, I can take a hint. Who needs you anyway? - I DO!
ga831025 -- I knew a cat who was so ugly, he had to tie a squirrel around his neck to make the dog chase him. - BAP! KONK! - It's nice to see I'm attracting a crowd with some taste.
ga831026 -- I knew a dog who was really stupid... - He was so stupid, when he turned around to lie down, he had to stop to ask directions! - I thought that was better than a one-shoe joke.
ga831027 -- What do you get if you cross a cat with a doctor? - You get a cat with a low golf handicap. - BONK KONG!
ga831028 -- Did you hear the one about the bucktoothed chicken? - - He...uh, raised a lovely family, was a well-respected member of the community, and led a comfortable life, titty boom.
ga831029 -- Stop me if you've heard this one. - SMACK KONG! WHOP! BAP! - Let me rephrase that.
ga831030 -- - We are nearing the bewitching hour when evil forces well up within me. - I love it. EEEK! - Gargle snort drool YIP - Heh, heh, heh-another fruitful Halloween of scaring kids and dogs. - Rats. - My mom told me if I made this face too often,
ga831030 -- it would freeze in this position.
ga831031 -- Here's some chicken soup, Garfield. - No thanks, I really couldn't. - I've never known Garfield to refuse food.
ga831101 -- - I'm taking this steak and there's nothing you can do about it, Chipmunk Cheeks. - I've always encouraged Garfield to be assertive. But I believe he's crossed the fine line to obnoxious.
ga831102 -- BONK! BONK! - BONK! BONK! - Odie's going to have to learn to walk one of these ways.
ga831103 -- I wonder what pets do when they don't know their owners are watching. - Let's find out. - I don't believe it. Neither do I. Odie just drew to an inside straight.
ga831104 -- CLANG! - Hey, Garfield, how do you like my new dinner bell? - It got my attention.
ga831105 -- - Oh no! My legs are turning to jelly! My mind is turning to mush! Could it be a laser? ...a death ray? No! It's... - My sunbeam.
ga831106 -- This looks like a good place to sit and muse. - What is the thing called life, Odie? - Montaigne said, "The value of life lies not in the length of days, but in how we make use of them." - Holmes said, "Life is painting a picture, not doing a
ga831106 -- sum." - James said, "Be not afraid of life. Believe that your life is worth living, and your belief will help create the fact." - - poo Odie, sometimes I envy you.
ga831107 -- Hey, Garfield, we're going to visit aunt Gussie. - I know she's old and mean, but underneath she has a heart of gold. - I hear she used to double-date with Lizzie Borden.
ga831108 -- Hi, aunt Gussie. Well if this isn't my daydreaming nephew, Jon, and his cat Blubberbutt. - Look, rodent breath, if you come within ten feet of my canary, I'll make a doily out of your hide. - I like her.
ga831109 -- Why, aunt Gussie! I didn't know you were homecoming queen in 1922. You bet. - Back then I had beauty, style, grace, charm... - And a body that wouldn't quit!
ga831110 -- How are you getting along financially these days, aunt Gussie? - Oh, I have my social security, I make quilts and sell my African violets... - And I knock down three hun a week teaching slam dancing at Denny's Pogo Pit.
ga831111 -- What would you like for Christmas, aunt Gussie? Oh...nothing much. - Maybe something for my bed like a little lacey throw pillow. - Stuffed with John Travolta's chest hair.
ga831112 -- It was nice visiting with you, aunt Gussie. Same here, Jon. - And you'd better forget about your crush on John Travolta. He's young enough to be your grandson. - DON'T TELL THAT TO MY COMPUTER DATING SERVICE!
ga831113 -- click! - Well, look who's in the television set. - Garfield is such a clown. - Ha-ha-ha. - WAH HA HA - Wait a minute! - Something just occurred to me.
ga831114 -- Look at all those people. All going to work to process food, produce electricity, manufacture kitty litter and so on. - All just for me. - I'd thank them individually, but they know who they are.
ga831115 -- Odie - WHOCK! SPLAT - That's for not being a cat.
ga831116 -- I guess I shouldn't have clobbered Odie for not being a cat. - If everyone had a choice, we'd all be cats. So I can't blame him for not being a cat. - This is for being a dog! punt!
ga831117 -- whirrr - glup plop - How's your cat food, Garfield? I could say more for the presentation.
ga831118 -- Oh, look, it's one of those things you pull on for service. - YANK! - Bring me a danish and a cup of coffee.
ga831119 -- - Stop playing with your food, Garfield. - I'm not. It dried out while my face was in it.
ga831120 -- This looks like a good place for a little nap-nap. - - - click WHIRRR - GASP! - SPLAT! - Hello, mom? The washing machine just spit out my jockey shorts. That's one thing I'd never admit to my mother.
ga831121 -- Here you go, Garfield. Take a big bite. - OH NO! - Just kidding.
ga831122 -- - SLAM! Yo, Garfield! What'cha doing? - Casting a critical eye on a career as a doorstep.
ga831123 -- Sitting atop this door, I see all and know all. - Now where's that fat cat of mine? - Don't take my name in vain. SMACK!
ga831124 -- Perching high on a door gives vent to a cat's philosophical bent. - Observing life from an omniscient point of view allows one to witness fascinating human rituals. - Like Jon cleaning his ear. squeak squeak
ga831125 -- I wish I knew how to get off this door. - Sometimes it would be nice to have all the decisions made for you. - SLAM! and sometimes not.
ga831126 -- PLOP - Where did you come from, Garfield? - Rumor has it the stork brought me.
ga831127 -- - - - - - - They didn't call me the shimmy king for nothing.
ga831128 -- I hate mondays. I can't shake this awful feeling that something dreadful is going to happen to me. - I'm saved! It's nice to see a friendly face. - You're going to the vet, Garfield. ARRRGH!
ga831129 -- You don't look happy, Garfield. - Happy about going to the clinic? Put yourself in my shoes. - You get to flirt with the lady vet while I get the business end of her thermometer.
ga831130 -- Did you know I'm a medical curiosity, doc? I'm not surprised. - I'm missing a major organ. Your brain? - My heart, you've stolen it away. I hate to see a doctor cry.
ga831201 -- I'd like to make another appointment, Liz. Sure, when? - How about Friday night for dinner? - NO! Subtle but firm.
ga831202 -- Your cat is in good health, Mr. Arbuckle. Dandy. Now let's talk about us. - Let's do. Really? - You owe me forty dollars. I just adore love patter.
ga831203 -- Hi, Odie. - - If that dog's brain were a car, it would be jammed in neutral.
ga831204 -- GASP! - OH NO! WE'RE OUT OF COFFEE! - This is your fault, you guzzler! You didn't buy any! - Look at us, Garfield. We're getting irritable and shaky. We need coffee! - SNIFF...WHAZAT?! ZAT!S COFFEE! - EEEK! LOOK, HUBERT! PEEPING TOMS! Don't
ga831204 -- flatter yourself, Reba. Now go hide the silver.
ga831205 -- It's time you earn your keep around here, Garfield. There's a mouse hole and there's some cheese. You know what to do. - I certainly do. -
ga831206 -- Here's the scenario: cat crouches by cheese waiting for mouse to exit hole to retrieve same. Cat catches mouse. Fade out. The End. - Heck with it. - I prefer stories with a happy ending.
ga831207 -- Why should I have to catch an innocent little mouse? I have nothing against him. In fact, he's kind of lovable. - If you don't catch that mouse, I'm putting you out i the cold! - The furry twerp dies.
ga831208 -- This is demeaning. I have a noble heritage. I am a unique, vital individual. - And all I'm considered as around here is a mousetrap. - I must speak to my kitty litter changer about that.
ga831209 -- I don't want to catch that mouse. He's cute. I've even nicknamed him... - - "Stretch"
ga831210 -- - - Live and let live, I say.
ga831211 -- * _ I'm just a ramlin' kind of guy...ramlin', ramblin' - rambl - - Oh, no! I've heard terrible things about city sewers! - They say the pet alligators that are flushed into the sewers grow to huge proportions. - But this is ridiculous.
ga831212 -- OH NO! DON'T MAKE ME DO IT! ANYTHING BUT THAT! - TURN BACK! TURN BACK! - Sometimes, a cat's feet just gotta climb.
ga831213 -- Here I am, stuck up a tree. Things couldn't be worse. - Okay, okay, NOW things couldn't be worse. - BOOM
ga831214 -- I maybe stranded up a tree... - But at least I'm on a sturdy limb. - The story of my life.
ga831215 -- Hey, fatso. What does a bird like you eat? - Cats. - chirp chirp
ga831216 -- This isn't safe. - Shoo! Shoo! Somebody might get hurt! - TOING!
ga831217 -- A way down! All I have to do is dive into that birdbath. - - 7.0 6.5
ga831218 -- Uh-oh, I feel a sneeze coming on! - Wah, wah. - WAH! WAH! WAH! - WACHOO! - Auntie em! Auntie em! Yeah, I got you, my pretty, and your little dog, too.
ga831219 -- 'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse; The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, in hope that St. Nicholas soon would be there; FILL THIS ONE, SANTA! - The children
ga831219 -- were nestled all snug in their beds, While visions of sugarplums danced in their heads; NOW GIMME A VISION OF LASAGNA - And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap, had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap. THIS IS MY KIND OF
ga831219 -- STORY.
ga831220 -- When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter. Away to the window I flew like a flash, Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash. WHAT'S A SASH? - The moon on the breast of the new-fallen
ga831220 -- snow Gave the luster of midday to objects below. When, what to my wondering eyes should appear. But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer. THEY LOOK BIGGER ON TELEVISION. - With a little old driver, so lively and quick, I knew in a
ga831220 -- moment it must be St. Nick. OR MAYBE SANTA CLAUS.
ga831221 -- More rapid than eagles his coursers they came. And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name; "Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen! On, Comet! On, Cupid! On, Donder and Blitzen! ON, DOPEY! ON, SNEEZY! ON, HAPPY! - "To
ga831221 -- the top of the porch! To the top of the wall! Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all! CAN'T THEY JUST WALK ANYWHERE? - As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky, So up to the housetop
ga831221 -- the coursers, they flew, With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas, too. TUNE IN TOMORROW. THE GOOD PART'S COMING.
ga831222 -- And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof The prancing and pawing of each little hoof. As I drew in my head, and was turning around, Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound. OH, NO! A CHIMNEY MONSTER! - He was dressed all in fur,
ga831222 -- from his head to his foot, and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot; A bundle of toys he had flung on his back, And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack. YOU DIDN'T BREAK ANY TOYS; DID YOU? - His eyes-how they
ga831222 -- twinkled! His dimples how merry! His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry! His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow; HE ALSO HAS A WELL-ROUNDED PERSONALITY.
ga831223 -- The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth. And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath; He had a broad face and a little round belly That shook when he laughed, like a bowiful of jelly. HO! HO! HO! A FEW SIT-UPS WOULD TAKE CARE OF
ga831223 -- THAT, FELLA. - He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf. And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself; A wink of his eye and a twist of his head Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread. WE MUST HAVE LUNCH SOMETIME. - He spoke
ga831223 -- not a word, but went straight to his work, and filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk, and laying his finger aside of his nose. And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose; HOW DID HE DO THAT?
ga831224 -- He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, And away they all flew like to down of a thistle. But I heard him exclaim, are he drove out of sight, - HAPPY CHRISTMAS TO ALL AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT! WHAT A NICE GUY, WHAT A NICE STORY. -
ga831224 -- Have a happy and loving holiday season.
ga831225 -- - Merry Christmas, Garfield. I got you some great presents! - Here is a radio controlled mouse... - And a mink scratching post! - ptoo - Odie, that bone is everything you own in the world. - It's the expensive gifts that impress me.
ga831226 -- Heh he rattle rattle - Cats have such active imaginations. I wonder what's going on in Garfield's mind right now. - Well...here I am, in a brown paper bag.
ga831227 -- Interesting. - Residing in a brown paper bag gives one an all-new perspective of one's self. - I feel like a dirty magazine.
ga831228 -- This bag needs eyeholes. - rip rustle rustle - Something's not right here.
ga831229 -- Got my sack, got my eyeholes, what more could a cat need? - ARRRRGH! - Armholes, definitely armholes.
ga831230 -- Awk! There's someone in this bag with me. - Oh, it's you. - Hello, bellybutton.
ga831231 -- fffff - POW! - I didn't know you were in the bag, Garfield. I was playing a trick on Odie. At least I died for a good cause.
ga840101 -- Oh boy, what a party, I ate too much. - I gotta get up and exercise. Here I go. - Okay, here I go o the count of three...one, two, three and up! - Up...up and exercise. Come on, Garfield. You can do it. - This time I'm really going to do it.
ga840101 -- Here go the legs lifting the body...now! - This time I'm really, really going to do it...one, two, three...Hi ya! - Have you been up today, Garfield? I think so.
ga840102 -- Rise and shine, Garfield, It's a bright new day! - It's gonna be a wonderful day, a great day! - I think I overcheerfuled it.
ga840103 -- How do you want your coffee, Garfield? Make it sit up and bark. - How's this? - Just right.
ga840104 -- - - Oh, no! It's the old "Disguise the tongue as a loaf of french bread" trick!
ga840105 -- Okay, who loosened the top on my saltshaker?! - Garfield, that wasn't very nice. You're right, that wasn't very nice. - But it was extremely funny.
ga840106 -- Go outside and play, Garfield. - Have a good time. - "Have a good time." he says.
ga840107 -- - Hey, Garfield, don't eat the lasagna yet... - It's still too hot. You're telling me?
ga840108 -- - - - - - -
ga840109 -- Don't eat me. You're too fat already! - Who are you? This is your conscience speaking. - I don't have a conscience. I know. I'm free-lancing.
ga840110 -- If you are my conscience, what are you doing in my food bowl? I took on a form you would understand. - What do you really look like? Well, if you must know... - I look like everyone's mother. Natch.
ga840111 -- Tell me, conscience, just what does a conscience do? - It is my duty to make you feel bad about things that make you feel good. - That's sad. It's a living.
ga840112 -- Well, conscience, if you don't mind, I'll go to bed now. Tah tah - Look both ways before crossing the street. - What's that supposed to mean? Sorry, it was just a knee-jerk nag.
ga840113 -- I can't believe my conscience is following me around. I must be cracking up. - A little nap-nap should clear my head. - You sleep too much. ACK
ga840114 -- Don't you think you should be getting up now? - Look, conscience, get out of my life. I have no use for you. Careful, fella. or I'll call my big brother. - Who's he? Guilt. On the jogging track in 5 minutes, sucker! Be there!
ga840115 -- Good morning, ham, good morning, eggs, good morning, milk. - There's one nice thing about visiting the farm... - The food is fresh. - Here, lunch. Here, lunch. - Uh-oh. - This is not good. - Garfield! Where have you been?! At Custer's last
ga840115 -- stand.
ga840116 -- I love it when the good humor man comes. DING DING - I love it when I get a popsicle. - I hate it when my lips stick to the *@!! popsicle.
ga840117 -- Ever notice how moths circle the light? - Like planets orbiting a distant sun. - I love it when I get philosophical.
ga840118 -- I wonder what happens when a moth gets too close to the light. - AYIEEEE! FOOM! - At least he didn't suffer.
ga840119 -- Let us examine a pet phenomenon called the "rips". - That's when your pets race around the house for no apparent reason. - Other than to mangle the family cat.
ga840120 -- You boys stop racing around. - Garfield, slow down! - Okay.
ga840121 -- Would you like to go for a walk, Odie? - Let's see...I need a leash. - You stay out of this.
ga840122 -- - I love sacks. - I wouldn't kid you, Parnelli. This honey will do 0-60 in 6 seconds flat. - I swear, Sally, get your head out of the sand. The sack dress is coming back. - I think I'll step into the root cellar and see what's for dinner. -
ga840122 -- OH, NO! - Hello, maintenance? Call the exterminator, my condo has dogs.
ga840123 -- - Good morning, Garfield. It's me, Nermal. I'm young and good-looking and you're not. - I didn't need that.
ga840124 -- Can I get you anything for breakfast, Garfield? - Yeah, how about a big glass of freshly-squeezed kitten juice? - You don't like me, don't you?
ga840125 -- How cute! Nermal brought me my newspaper! - And my slippers and my pipe! What more could a man want? - How about a woman?
ga840126 -- Let's get you into trouble, Nermal. - Look in the cookie jar! Look in the cookie jar! No, you can't have a cookie, Garfield, You'll spoil dinner. - Thanks for the cookies. Jeff would have known what Lassie was talking about.
ga840127 -- - BLUT! BLUT! - Call it cruel. Call it juvenile. I call it asserting myself.
ga840128 -- I hate to bother you, sir, but you put insufficient postage on your package. - What package? - This kitten you're sending to Abu Dhabi. GARFIELD
ga840129 -- Poor me. - What a yucky evening. - It's dark and rainy and there's nothing on television. - I crave sunshine, daisy-filled meadows and good times. I need a ticket out of here. - Wait a minute! I have one! SNAP! -
ga840130 -- I wonder how fast I can run. - I wonder what would happen if I hit this kitty door at Mach 2. - I wonder if killing a mailman is a federal offense.
ga840131 -- I love attacking the mailman. Some days I scratch him. Some days I bite him. Some days I trip him. - Today I'm trying something new. * - I'm humiliating him.
ga840201 -- * - ARRRGH! b-b-b-b - When he comes around, he'll thank me for breaking up the monotony of his dreary job.
ga840202 -- Come on, mailman, deliver that mail. - And when you do, I'm going to leap on you and all that will be left will be your mailbag and that silly-looking hat of yours. - Has the mailman come yet, Garfield? No, he's still standing at the end of
ga840202 -- the sidewalk sobbing.
ga840203 -- SLAM! - Rats! I missed him! - Apparently, no one ever told him to look both ways before crossing the street. SCREECH
ga840204 -- Be a good boy and fetch the mail, Garfield. Oui, mon capitaine. - RIP ROWT CLOBBER BLAP - Did you hurt him bad? Oh, just a few lacerations, abrasions and internal injuries. I was in a good mood.
ga840205 -- plop! - - GLUP! - ptoo ptoo - SPLUT! - Salvage the pride, Garfield, salvage the pride.
ga840206 -- Hey, Garfield, it says here people can perform superhuman feats of strength during periods of great stress. - What baloney! - By the way, I'm taking you to the vet today.
ga840207 -- You can't hide from forever, Garfield. I'm going to find you and take you to the vet. - You may be sneaky, but I'm sneakier. - "Sneaky" is my middle name.
ga840208 -- Garfield can't resist lasagna, and when he comes to eat it, I'm going to catch him and take him to the vet. - SMACK GULP SLURP - That cat has the longest lips I've ever seen.
ga840209 -- Now where could Garfield be? - He's not in tie cookies, and he certainly won't be in the doggie biscuits. - POO! It's a good thing I can't read.
ga840210 -- Aha! There you are, Garfield! You're going to the vet now. - - Sorry, Odie. SMACK
ga840211 -- I wish I could find Garfield's hiding place so I could take him to the vet. - He's sure hiding in a good place. - A good place-- Not a smart place-- But a good place.
ga840212 -- I can't believe my luck. This is too perfect. - I will now slide down this banister and make a four-point landing on Odie down there. - BANZAI! - - RATS! - I can see the headline now: "Twist in plot fatal to local cat".
ga840213 -- Wouldn't it be great if everything could talk? - I'd get out of bed and the wall would say, "Good morning, Jon." and the sink would say, "Good morning, Jon." That wouldn't be so hot. - Every time a light bulb burned out, it would be like a
ga840213 -- death in the family.
ga840214 -- If people had hair all over their bodies, would they wear clothing? - - Probably not.
ga840215 -- What would happen if people were cats and cats were people? - That's an easy one. - Dogs would soon be extinct.
ga840216 -- I was wondering, Garfield... - What if being fat were considered attractive? - What do you mean, "what if," bozo?
ga840217 -- I wonder what life would be like if we never had to eat. - That would take some getting used to. - For a time, mothers would fix their families three square nothings a day.
ga840218 -- What if there were never a Leonardo da Vinci? - That would be awful! - The da Vinci kids would have been orphans.
ga840219 -- RING! - BRING! SMASH! - DING DING DING DING - STOMP! STOMP! STOMP! - GASP! COUGH WHEEzeeee - SHOOP! - Rats! Too late! Now I'm wide awake.
ga840220 -- I hate mondays. - This is your conscience speaking. It's not nice to hate mondays. Look at it as starting a fresh week with a clean slate. - I hate mondays.
ga840221 -- This is your conscience speaking. Don't you dare push Odie off the table! That would be inhumane and cruel. - Then YOU push him off. POKE! - That was kind of fun.
ga840222 -- Why do you follow me around, conscience? If I don't you won't be very nice. - If I put this cork in your bottle would you be trapped? Yes, but that wouldn't be very nice. - That wasn't very nice.
ga840223 -- Now that my conscience is trapped in this bottle, I can walk away and enjoy myself. - That's okay, go ahead, have fun, don't worry about me. I'll just sit here in the dark...all alone. - You're very good. One of the best.
ga840224 -- Let's have some fun, Garfield. Take one step back. Okay. - - I thought consciences were supposed to be nice! I'm on break.
ga840225 -- I have my conscience trapped in this bottle. I'll just set it by Jon. - - Get a haircut.
ga840226 -- tappity tappity tappity - Good evening, ladies and germs. In our audience tonight is a boy scout delegation from Booga-Booga. Welcome, guys. - I'm dedicating my first song to you. Appropriately enough it's called, "I'm just a boy scouting for
ga840226 -- the key to your heart". - HEY! - All right, you Booga-Booga boobs! - If you're going to throw anything, throw money, okay? ...okay. - CLOBBER - Silly me, I forgot the only currency in Booga-Booga is 800-pound chariot wheels.
ga840227 -- What a glorious morning! - I could really enjoy a morning like this. - If I could only get this catch out of my back.
ga840228 -- I gotta get help for this catch in my back. - Hey, guys. - What we have here is a failure to communicate.
ga840229 -- Maybe a good night's sleep will help me get rid of this catch in my back. - - Maybe not.
ga840301 -- I hate having a catch in my back. I get no sleep, I get no food, I get no exercise. - - Don't tip the cat over, Odie. I get no respect.
ga840302 -- Well hello there, Mr. Stuck-Up. - Having a catch in one's back does tend to give one an air of sophistication... - I could get to like this.
ga840303 -- Let's take care of that catch in your back, Garfield. - CRINK! - There you go, old buddy. Thanks, I think.
ga840304 -- Hey, look! Odie! - It snowed last night! - Ha ha, so you boys want to play in the snow, huh? - First you'll have to wear your nice, warm pet sweaters. - And your wool caps and mittens and mufflers and booties. - There you go, boys. - Having
ga840304 -- fun yet? Ha ha ha, wheee.
ga840305 -- Who's that painting at my door? - HONK HONK - Oh, good morning, Odie. HONK
ga840306 -- YAWN - GASP! - Waking up to my own bad breath is bad enough, but someone else's is unbearable.
ga840307 -- I am proud to be a pet. Pets lend a touch of elegance to a home. SLUP SLUP - - I am proud to be a cat. SLUP SLUP
ga840308 -- Okay, get revved up there, Odie. - GO! - I love toys that don't need batteries.
ga840309 -- - crinkle - May I have some of that candy bar? Here, take it.
ga840310 -- - I declare this steak the sovereign property of Garfield, the cat! - I've never had my dinner annexed before. And you may never see it alive again.
ga840311 -- - SMACK Let's play! - Leave me alone, Garfield. Let's play! Let's play! - Oh, okay, we'll play. - TICKLE! TICKLE! TICKLE! TICKLE! HA! HA! HEE! HO! HEE! HEE! - OUCH! - I'm through playing now.
ga840312 -- Hey, Garfield, we're going to the farm to visit dad and mom this week. - Goodo. I need a change of surroundings. I was getting bored with this city life. - It will be nice to be bored in the country for a change.
ga840313 -- It's great to be back on the farm, Garfield. Nothing ever changes. - The same old surroundings, the same old room... - The same old chores. The same old manure.
ga840314 -- This pastoral scene is not exactly intellectually stimulating. - Read any good books lately? Oink. - "Oink," he says. I rest my case. "Oink" in the existential sense, of course.
ga840315 -- Doc, do you ever regret that you stayed on the farm while I went to the city to live in the lap of luxury? - Not really. Dad will probably will the farm to me, and I'll sell the acreage at a huge profit and retire while young. - Need a hired
ga840315 -- hand? Give me a resume and three good references. And mom doesn't count.
ga840316 -- Beautiful sunset, isn't it, dad? Purtyer than a little red wagon goin' up a hill. - What does that mean? - Oh, it's just something you city boys expect us farmers to say. How true.
ga840317 -- Garfield and I must be leaving now, mom. Stay, stay! I just baked some pies. - We gotta go. Come on, Garfield. - Say what, stranger?
ga840318 -- WHEW! - Today I am going to cure Garfield of his gluttony. - Go to it, boy! - He's either going to get sick eating all that food, or he's going to burst trying. MUNCH SMACK SLURP - Are you going to want the rest of that hamburger?
ga840319 -- AWK! - I love chasing birds. - Except when they do that.
ga840320 -- BONK! Rats! - Double rats! - And, of course, tripe rats.
ga840321 -- Shoo! - Flies and I have a lot in common... - You can't keep either of us away from food.
ga840322 -- I gotta beat that fly to my food! - I WIN! - You lose, fella. POO
ga840323 -- - WHEW - BOO!
ga840324 -- * - REARRR! - It's the old "bring in the reinforcements" trick.
ga840325 -- - - All right, you guys! Outside! - - - Where were you guys raised, in a barn? Next time use the door. - CRASH! Thank you.
ga840326 -- GARFIELD! I CAN'T STRAIGHTEN UP! - ZIP - Ha, ha, my tie was caught in my zipper. Help me.
ga840327 -- Gimme those cookies. - HIYA! HUT! KONK! PUNT! - I'd turn her in, but who'd admit to being mangled by a girl scout?
ga840328 -- Rise and shine, Garfield! - Garfield? - clunk clunk Time to wash my blankey, what say?
ga840329 -- Be a good boy and fetch the morning paper, Garfield. - Yes, master. I am your beck and call, master. - Why can't I have a normal house cat like everyone else?
ga840330 -- I need a brain for my master. - - A brain, I need a brain for my master.
ga840331 -- Ah, coffee. - - Being a hunchback is going to take some getting used to.
ga840401 -- This is it, boys. - Tonight we find out who the phantom ripper is. - He's stepping out the shadows now. - Oh, no! It's...it's you! AYIEEE! - Good movie. click - Who was he? - We thought YOU were watching. SMACK GRRRRR
ga840402 -- It's Monday out there. I feel it in the air. I hate mondays. - I'm sure the world will end on a Monday...at least I hope it does. - It would be a shame to end the world right before a weekend.
ga840403 -- Pooky, where are you? Oh, no! My teddy bear is missing. - This has the makings of a classic mystery. I already have some prime suspects. - It's easy when you live with a rogue's gallery.
ga840404 -- I suspect Odie of kidnapping Pooky. Watch him crumble under my keen questioning. - Where were you on the evening of April 1?! - What am I doing? Odie doesn't even know where he is now.
ga840405 -- There must be clue to Pooky's disappearance here somewhere... - Aha! could this be a telltale trail of teddy bear hair? - Even if it isn't, that was a pretty nifty bit of alliteration.
ga840406 -- Hello, what's this? Just as my teddy bear disappears, this sack mysteriously appears... - Something smells fishy here. -
ga840407 -- Aha! Jon! It was you who kidnapped Pooky! - Obviously, sensing I was hot on his trail and fearing my wrath, he's decided to return Pooky and throw himself on the mercy of the court. - I had your teddy bear cleaned, Garfield. Sigh...thank you.
ga840408 -- - - * AROOOOOOO * - tappity tappity clap clap clap - I like you, Garfield. - And I like myself, Arlene. I can take a hint. - Like myself when I'm with you that is.
ga840409 -- It's nearly midnight on a Monday. - I can't believe it! Nothing bad has happened to me all day. - COO-COO!
ga840410 -- Watch this. It's the old rubber bone gag. - SHOOP! - Practical jokes are wasted on the stupid.
ga840411 -- SQUIT - BLAT - Unnnngh! Help! Help! The alien is sucking my brain dry! Garfield has raised playing with food to an art form
ga840412 -- Garfield, I think it's time we grow up, be more responsible, take a more mature outlook on life... Hee hee - I don't think you're taking me seriously! I'm sorry. - I don't know what came over me.
ga840413 -- Stop begging, Garfield. You may have any food that falls on the floor. - - I hate you. I can live with that.
ga840414 -- Hee-hee, snort. - WAH-HA-HA! - Okay! Okay! I'm awake!
ga840415 -- Look out, world. - I feel invincible today. - FOOD! I CRAVE FOOD! - That took nearly three seconds, Jon. We'll do better next time, won't we? - I shall take my morning stroll mow. Be a good boy and alert the media. - Hold up, traffic. Here
ga840415 -- comes Garfield. Where were you? Learning that some things can't be intimidated.
ga840416 -- - - I'm sorry. Did I bring you down, old buddy? Like a rock, old buddy.
ga840417 -- I'm bored, Garfield. - I'm tired of seeing the same old scenery. Do you know what I mean? Not really. - At least you get to see the scenery.
ga840418 -- Garfield, there's only one way to shed this shroud of gray we wear... - There's only one path out of this valley of gloom. There's only one sure bet to beat the boreds. - Gather your things. We're going to vacation! I'm packed. Let's go!
ga840419 -- How much are the plane tickets? ...uh, do you have anything cheaper? - That could be fatal! - I don't think they want out business, Garfield. Where's the competition for the low rollers these days?
ga840420 -- Thank you very much. - Garfield, I had to book our vacation all third-class. I hope you don't mind. That's okay. - It's still better than this fourth-class existence at home.
ga840421 -- Let's blow this joint, Garfield. - Hang on! - Where did you go? To give the refrigerator a goodbye kiss.
ga840422 -- Thank heavens for these reduced airline rates, Garfield. No frills, no food, no class. - Welcome to Inversion Layer Airlines, sir. In what section are you traveling? Uh...third class. - What section, sir? Third class. - I can't hear you!
ga840422 -- THIRD CLASS! - In the back with the rest of the slime, you vermin! - Why can't I get any respect, Garfield? In this game, you must BUY respect, my friend.
ga840423 -- I haven't seen a stewardess in hours, Garfield. - I'm going to find out what's going on around here. - Excuse me sir. How's the service on this airline?
ga840424 -- Hey! We're getting hungry here in third-class! What's to eat?! - BLAT! BLAT! - Hardtack and swill. Yum-yum. CONK! CONK!
ga840425 -- Nyah! Nyah! Nyah! Nyah! - Mikey, it's not nice to make fun of people, even though they ARE traveling in third-class. - NO! GARFIELD, NO! LET ME HURT 'EM JUST A LITTLE BIT!
ga840426 -- - I know this is just the third-class exit from the plane, Garfield... - But you'd think they'd give us a ladder or something.
ga840427 -- I would like your cheapest room for me and my cat. Yes, sir. That would be the Jack Benny suite, sir. - Well, Garfield, there's the bed and the bathroom's down the hall. Any questions? Yes... - Where are YOU going to sleep?
ga840428 -- All I have to do is unpack, Garfield, and we'll be ready for some rest and relaxation. - ARRRRGH! NOT ANOTHER PET TO TAKE CARE OF! - I don't think I can take any more surprises. Then don't look at what Odie did to your sport jacket.
ga840429 -- - You guys have a good time, but no digging in the sand, if you know what I mean? - Hey, baby! What's your sign? - Careful, buddy. She's MY girl. - Aw, go pound sand, you little twerp - - Well...I guess we are to do as he says, not as he
ga840429 -- does.
ga840430 -- Hey, Garfield! Are you ready to go play golf? - - Aren't you coming? On second thought, I think I'd rather stay in the room and watch the sink back-up
ga840501 -- ODIE! GET AWAY FROM THAT TREE! GARFIELD! GET OUT OF THAT SAND TRAP! - Would you mind observing proper golf etiquette there, mister? - I'm sorry, but my pets are driving me nuts. It's the outfit I'm talking about.
ga840502 -- CRACK! - Oh, no! I hit an old lady in the head and knocked her out cold! - What should I do, Garfield? I'd straighten that left arm and turn that right hand over more.
ga840503 -- - ROWR! - GARFIELD! WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THAT SAND TRAP? Squatting on a sandburg, thank you.
ga840504 -- Well, boys, it's been a nice vacation, but it's time to head home. - Good heavens! What happened to you guys?! - Odie discovered how to dial room service. Burp.
ga840505 -- Here we are! Home sweet home! - ARRRGH! - OKAY; WHO LEFT THE FAUCET RUNNING?! I didn't want my sponge collection to dry out.
ga840506 -- - MY BED! ODIE'S SLEEPING IN MY BED! - This calls for a good stomping! - STOMP STOMP STOMP - - - So much for my french bread and olive collection.
ga840507 -- Some people wonder why I hate mondays. - Maybe I'm fatalistic. - But I suspect I'm just stupid.
ga840508 -- scratch scratch scratch - WHAM! - I'm not very fond of Tuesday, either.
ga840509 -- I am absolutely not getting out of bed today. - Hey, Garfield. There's a spider on your blanket. - I keep forgetting we live in a generation without absolutes.
ga840510 -- I'll teach him to be a spider! STOMP STOMP STOMP STOMP STOMP - He won't have the guts to do that again. - STOMP STOMP Better safe than sorry. STOMP STOMP STOMP
ga840511 -- Look at this. - A cat stroking his owner! - Why so affectionate, Garfield? I just squashed a spider.
ga840512 -- - SLUG - Big day.
ga840513 -- - Fetch the stick, Odie! - - -
ga840514 -- I'm lonely. I think I'll see if I can find Arlene. - Hi there. You two-timing swine! - What happened?
ga840515 -- Hi, Arlene. DON'T SPEAK TO ME, YOU CAD, I SAW YOU WITH THAT OTHER WOMAN! - Oh come on now, do I look like the kind of guy who could easily attract women? I suppose you're right. And just what do you mean by that?
ga840516 -- Here is your dinner, my dear. BLAT - Is this food fresh? Ha ha ha, why of course! - This is only yesterday's newspaper.
ga840517 -- Aren't you going to join me for dinner, Garfield? Uh...no thank you. I'm on a diet. - A diet?! How long have you been on a diet? - Oh, for about 18 seconds now.
ga840518 -- Ho hum... - Why do we see each other? It beats being lonely. - I was hoping for something more romantic. That's way down the list.
ga840519 -- - Is our date over? Did it begin? - Some women don't appreciate us strong, silent types.
ga840520 -- tappity tappity tappity - Good evening, folks. Here's a joke...what did the beaver say when he heard the chain saw? - CHUKONG! - Chirp Chirp They're playing my song. - All of your mothers wear army boots. - KONG CRASH! BAP! - Why do you do
ga840520 -- it, Garfield? I loooove the attention.
ga840521 -- I hate Monday. That's the day people go back to work, kids go back to school... - - And diets begin.
ga840522 -- Garfield, you're too fat. I can't help it. - I have a slow metabolism. - A reeeeeeal slow metabolism.
ga840523 -- Do you know what I hate about diets? - Eating is social. - But when you diet, you diet alone.
ga840524 -- I think I have a way out of this diet. - I know I'm too fat for a cat... - But, I'm just right for a bumblebee!
ga840525 -- How goes the diet, Garfield? - ROAR - What was that?! That was my stomach, you twit.
ga840526 -- - AYIEEEEE! - Everyone's a critic. cough weeze
ga840527 -- * - Oh no! - I've tangle wit that dog before. - If I take my eyes off him, he'll clobber me! - I can't stand it. - WHONGO! - Why did you do that? I hit him back first.
ga840528 -- I hate mondays. Garfield, I don't know why you hate mondays so much. - BLAT! - SEE?!!!
ga840529 -- Good morning, Garfield. - I made your coffee just like you like it. - Strong.
ga840530 -- Oh shucks, I just spilled the only cup of coffee we have in the house. - -
ga840531 -- * ROWR * - WHOCK! - Garfield, where did the flowers come from? Well, why don't we just read the note?
ga840601 -- You like to scratch things, don't you, Garfield? Does a chicken like to peck? Sure I do! - Good! Scratch my back. - NO CLAWS! NO CLAWS! If I didn't use claws, I wouldn't be scratching, now would I?
ga840602 -- Scratch higher, Garfield. - Higher! - Get off the curtains, Garfield. I was just following instructions.
ga840603 -- grrrr - RRRRRR Jon's best shoes! - Sometimes Odie makes me so angry, I could just scream. - - - - ARRRRRGH!
ga840604 -- Good morning, boys and girls. Good morning, uncle Roy. - I love you just the way you are. I love you too, uncle Roy. - I also love mondays. Stick it in your ear, uncle Roy.
ga840605 -- Good morning, boys and girls. I love you just the way you are. Everybody loves uncle Roy. - You are kind, thoughtful, obedient and considerate. - Not to mention intelligent, witty and charming. We all know uncle Roy is a liar, but we don't
ga840605 -- care.
ga840606 -- Here we are in a real factory, boys and girls. Let's see what we can learn... - ARRRRRGH! WHAP! WHAP! WHAP! - SHUT THIS **!* THING OFF. Uncle Roy is learning never to wear loose clothing around big machinery.
ga840607 -- Good morning, boys and girls. You are probably wondering where my dog, Bob, is this morning. - Wellll...it seems old Bob bit Mr. Blue Jeans the mailman once too often... - So Bob has decided to move to a local research facility to pursue a
ga840607 -- career as a laboratory animal. And I'm Frank Sinatra.
ga840608 -- Let's play pretend, boys and girls. Let's pretend it's contract negotiation time for uncle Roy... - And there are big green monsters who want to take uncle Roy off the air... - And the only thing that can save uncle Roy are letters saying how
ga840608 -- much you love uncle Roy. I hate to see a grown man grovel.
ga840609 -- Looks who's come to visit, boys and girls. It's Jerry the Cat. Hi, Jerry. Hi, uncle Roy. - How are you? I'm fine, How are you? Uncle Roy is getting pretty bizarre. - How's your mother? She's fine. Who'd be dumb enough to believe there is a
ga840609 -- talking cat?
ga840610 -- Hey, Jon, Look at this! - Hey, Jon. Watch me! - Jon doesn't pay any attention to me anymore. Watch this. - Hey, Jon! - Hey, Jon! - Hey, Garfield? What, Jon? - I don't pay any attention to me anymore.
ga840611 -- - - Don't you dare. I don't know what you're talking about.
ga840612 -- Every morning for nearly six years now, I fix raisin toast for Garfield. - He loves his raisin toast. - What's in the drawer? A six-year supply of raisins.
ga840613 -- * crack - OH, YUK! - It's not often you see a yolk with a beak.
ga840614 -- How would you like your bacon prepared, Garfield? Let's shoot for recognizable. - Jon is a terrible cook. He could ruin cereal. - Bacon flambe, yum yum.
ga840615 -- An interesting thing about food... - One minute it may be haute cuisine. - But the instant you put it into the sink, it becomes garbage.
ga840616 -- Here's your cereal, Garfield. - What's the matter? Aren't you hungry? Not really. - I think one of the flakes just moved.
ga840617 -- - I'm going to kick Odie off this table. - And he'll probably sprain something and have to go to the vet. - And I'll get lonely without him. - And Jon will be angry without me. - And the humane society will want to lynch me. - But nobody said
ga840617 -- life was a rose garden.
ga840618 -- I can't believe I turn six years old tomorrow. Some cats say, "Life begins at six," but I don't buy that. - Old age may take its toll on some cats, but it's not going to happen to me! I'm going to do something about it! - Right after my nap.
ga840619 -- Happy birthday, Garfield! I got you a rubber chicken. They're lots of fun! We'll see about that. - SMACK SPLUT - Chicken, you and I are going to have some good times.
ga840620 -- You need a name, fella. Let's see...what do you name a rubber chicken? - rrrrr - "Stretch"!
ga840621 -- peck peck peck - SMACK! - I'll have some ham and eggs, and my friend, Stretch, will have a bowl of rubber bands.
ga840622 -- peck peck peck - STOP PECKING ME WITH THAT RUBBER CHICKEN! - Aw, look, you just hurt Stretch's feelings. He brings out the worst in me.
ga840623 -- Pooky, I would like you to meet Stretch, my rubber chicken. - Quite frankly, Pooky and Stretch don't have a lot of personality. - But you have to trade off something when you surround yourself with good listeners.
ga840624 -- - YAWN It's bed-bye time again. - Tonight I think I'll take a deep breath, slowly close my eyes and savor the heavy feeling of sleep gradually overtaking my body. PAT! PAT! PAT! - Then again it would be fun to have a cup of coffee and toss
ga840624 -- and turn for a couple of hours, then sleep till noon. - Or maybe I'll run around the block, collapse into bed exhausted and fall asleep instantly. - Or I could watch the all-night movies on TV until my eyelids get so heavy I couldn't possibly
ga840624 -- hold them open any longer. - Sigh...so much sleeping to do and so few nights.
ga840625 -- Garfield, I think you're too mean to Odie. - I never want to see you hit him again. Oh, very well. - KONK!
ga840626 -- I'm going to the store, Garfield. If you lay a paw on Odie, I'll spank you. - - BOING
ga840627 -- Garfield, I swear you've done everything to Odie a cat could do to a dog. Au contraire. - PLINK - Never underestimate me.
ga840628 -- Hey, Odie! I found your nose! - Let me put it on for you, pal. squik squik - Very nice. I like you as a rat terrier.
ga840629 -- Well, well, well. I see you're eating my food, Odie. Now what are going to do with you? - We are going to kick you into next week! That's what we're going to do! PUNT - Where's Odie? Somewhere over saturday.
ga840630 -- Lunch isn't the same without Odie. He always slips up behind me, barks loudly and makes me fall into my food. - I guess I 'll just have to make do. - BLUT
ga840701 -- - I believe you're gaining weight, Garfield. I believe your eyeballs are shrinking. - Look at that soft belly. That's just water retention. - Now why do you suppose you're looking larger? An optical illusion? - The older you get', the bigger
ga840701 -- you get. Bigger-boned maybe. - You're fat, Garfield. I am not fat! - My center of gravity is just getting lower.
ga840702 -- I have this nagging feeling I'm forgetting something. - WHUMP! - Oh yes, I forgot I kicked Odie into next week, last week.
ga840703 -- Pooky loves me, I can tell. - He doesn't talk, he doesn't walk, he doesn't think. -  a little nothing goes a long way.
ga840704 -- I'm working up a routine for the fence tonight, Pooky. Tell me what you think of it. - I knew a teddy bear who was so ugly, even the tide wouldn't take it out. - BLAT!
ga840705 -- Good evening, ladies and germs. I'd like you to meet Pooky, my gag writer. - SPLAT - Welcome to the show biz, kid.
ga840706 -- Jump through the hoop, Pooky. - Hey, Garfield, what's happening? I'm pretending to teach Pooky tricks. -
ga840707 -- Butterflies are versatile. They can caress the air. - They can kiss the dew from the flowers. - And they can embed themselves in radiators. FWAP!
ga840708 -- scritch scritch - I'll be darned. These labels are loose. - * - It's the old "Cats get the tuna while the owner get the cat food" gag. - - Surprise, Garfield! I fixed us a tuna noodle casserole. - Oh, well, I guess a half a surprise is better
ga840708 -- than none at all.
ga840709 -- Garfield, I know you hate mondays. - But everything that could possibly happen to you has already happened. - Au contraire, power failure breath.
ga840710 -- Since we can't watch TV during a power failure, Garfield, what say we listen to the radio? - Ha ha! Do I feel stupid. That's because you ARE stupid. CLICK CLICK - How about a game of cards? No, thanks. I'm just going to sit here and cry for a
ga840710 -- while.
ga840711 -- I've learned something from this power failure, Garfield. - When you are deprived of your eyesight, isn't it amazing how much keener your other senses become? - Huh?
ga840712 -- Don't worry, Garfield. The power failure may have spoiled the food in the refrigerator... - But we still have lots of canned goods. - Now where's our electric opener? ARRRGH!
ga840713 -- Hey, Garfield, as long as the power is off, we might as well go out. - I have my bowling ball. Let's go bowling. - Get your fingers out of my eyes and your thumb out of my mouth, and I'll consider it.
ga840714 -- - Great! The power's back on! I can't think of anything worse than a power failure. - How about two power failures?
ga840715 -- Z Z - BABOOM! - SHOOP ZOOM - Allright you guys, get out of here. It's only a little thunderstorm. - Pets...they're just like kids. - CRACK KABOOM! - Urf! Give me some room, will you? Hey! Your feet are cold!
ga840716 -- And now, a word from our sponsor. - Hey, America. Here's a cat food we bet your cat will love. - You're on.
ga840717 -- Good morning, old buddy. - ARRRGH! That's only a piece of lint, Garfield. - It sure does a great spider impression.
ga840718 -- BARK! BARK! BARK! - Odie isn't really stupid. BONK - He's just chased one too many parked cars.
ga840719 -- Okay, you turkeys, I'm prepared for anything. - * AROOO * - CRASH!
ga840720 -- Garfield, if you mess with my new fish, you'll regret it. - What's so regrettable about a little seafood snack? - Jon's going to pay for this.
ga840721 -- - Well, well, Odie. I see you derive great pleasure from other's misfortune. - So do I! SNAP!
ga840722 -- - Garfield, where are yoooooou? - Get out of the breadbox, Garfield! - Get out from under the chair, Garfield! - Garfield, you know I hate it when you hide from me! - Oh, well. I'll find him sooner or later. There's only so many places a fat
ga840722 -- slob like him can hide. - Get out of the bookcase, Garfield.
ga840723 -- You sleep too much, Garfield. - Sometimes I do feel bad about sleeping so much. - What with all the insomniacs in China.
ga840724 -- What Odie needs is a good kick. - Uh-oh! Nap attack! - I don't even want to know. Z
ga840725 -- Z - Z SNORT! SNORT! Z
ga840726 -- Z - Z Whimper - No, Odie, Garfield isn't dead. He's just a hardcore sleeper.
ga840727 -- Are you going to sleep all day, Garfield? Let me check my social calendar. - Let's see...there's high tea with the Queen of England tomorrow, but nothing today. - Z Ask a stupid question...
ga840728 -- YAWN What a great night's sleep! - I'm ready to attack a fresh new day. - Good evening, Garfield. What's on the late movie?
ga840729 -- Good morning, Garfield. I'm hungry. - How would you like your egg prepared? I would like it hatched. - Raise it to young chickenhood on a diet of cracked corn, barley and sorghum molasses. - Then barbecue the dude.
ga840729 -- I should think a steak sauce and honey glaze would be nice. - - Scrambled? Scrambled.
ga840730 -- There's only one way to beat the heat today. - Where are you going, Garfield? To the beach. - Hello, beach.
ga840731 -- There's only one thing I  hate about the beach. - PONK! - It's always so crowded.
ga840801 -- GREAT! - - Surf's up!
ga840802 -- Garfield, I know you like to have fun... - But you look ridiculous. - Stand aside there, fella. Here comes my next wave.
ga840803 -- Okay, everyone out of the pool! I'm going swimming. - You! the one with the whistle-out! - I don't need a lifeguard.
ga840804 -- * - Rats. - I thought you were going swimming. The water was polluted.
ga840805 -- Hello, what have we here? - I think I'll draw something. - Hey, Garfield! This is a great drawing! Do you know what his means?! - A cat who can draw! We'll make millions. You'll be famous! - We'll tour the world! Live out a suitcase! You'll do
ga840805 -- thousands of drawings! - SLASH! - Why did you do that? Suddenly, life got too complicated.
ga840806 -- NO! NO! NO! DON'T MAKE ME DO IT! - ARRRGH! SOMEONE HELP ME! - Sometimes it's hard to fight primal instincts.
ga840807 -- Hello, lunch. - - Those bird's nets are deceptively large.
ga840808 -- Why do I do it? Why do I climb up trees when I can't climb down? - The neighborhood always turns out to see me. Then the fire department comes to get me. Then my picture ends up in the newspaper. - I just answered my own question.
ga840809 -- Oh good! Here comes a fireman to save me! - Terrific. Why do I always get the fat ones? - And the ones who are sensitive about their weight?
ga840810 -- I'm getting sleepy. - If birds can sleep in trees, so can I. - Z
ga840811 -- If I truly believe I'm a bird, I might be able to flap my arms and fly out of this tree. - I'm a bird! I'm a bird! - I hope birds' bones knit quickly.
ga840812 -- Ballet slippers? Uh-oh, Jon's getting weird on me. - See the ballet slippers I'm giving my niece, Garfield? I wish I had ballet slippers. - I'll let this niece has never been on pointe. - Or done a jete. - Or a pirouette. - POW! - What
ga840812 -- happened? I had a ballet slipper blow out on a bourree.
ga840813 -- - WHAP! - Sometime, somewhere, when you are least expecting it...Monday strikes.
ga840814 -- What's wrong with this picture? - There's no food in your bowl, Garfield. Give the man a cigar! Fill it up, turkey. - I hate it when lower life forms are condescending to me.
ga840815 -- I've been taken! There was only one kernel of popcorn in this whole bag. - Oh, well, one's better than nothing. - POP!
ga840816 -- Good morning, fern. How about a drink of water, little friend? - How nice, Garfield, I'm glad to see you take an interest in my fern. - I'm fattening it for slaughter.
ga840817 -- Where is it written that humans must give cats milk in saucers?! Why not in cups or bowls or pans? - SPLASH - SEE?! I think Garfield is trying to tell me something.
ga840818 -- What is it, Garfield? - Pick me up. Too fat to hop on the table, huh? - One of these days, I'll learn.
ga840819 -- - - SCRIK - SLUCK - SHLONK - TUCK - I love rubber pets.
ga840820 -- I'm bored, bored, bored. I need something to spice up my week. - THAT'S IT. - The caped avenger returns.
ga840821 -- Uh-oh. - RUN FOR COVER, ODIE! - Make way for the caped avenger. - Garfield is fantasizing again.
ga840822 -- The caped avenger seeks out evil wherever it may lurk. - - As long as it isn't in dark scary places.
ga840823 -- The caped avenger will now descend upon an old archenemy. - BLAT! - The caped avenger forgot to correct for crosswind.
ga840824 -- Be careful, mere mortal man! That food may be poisoned! The caped avenger will taste it for you. - - It's okay. (burp) Enjoy.
ga840825 -- The caped avenger pauses to wash his cape. - - The hankied avenger plods on.
ga840826 -- Hmmm. - This ladder gives me a great idea. - I'm going to glue my feet to the ceiling. - And blow Jon's mind. - This is going to be fun. - Unless, of course, Jon doesn't see me. - Unless, of course, Jon goes to bed.
ga840827 -- Guess what, Garfield! We're going to the farm this week. - Whoopty-doo. Going to the farm is like going to the zoo... - Where they eat everything but th cats.
ga840828 -- Dad! Mom! - Jon Boy! Jonny! - I wish they'd call me by my real name. You're right, dummy.
ga840829 -- Doc Boy! Don't call me Doc Boy! - What's with him, dad? Ever since he started wearing long pants, he's hated the be called "Boy". - How long has that been? Since last thursday. A late bloomer.
ga840830 -- I know we're brothers, Doc Boy, but do you think we've grown apart since I moved to the city? Don't call me Doc Boy. - How would you like it if I called you a city slicker? I wouldn't like that. - DOC BOY! DOC BOY! DOC BOY! SLICKER! SLICKER!
ga840830 -- SLICKER! Boys! Boys! Boys!
ga840831 -- Well, Garfield, this week you learned where bacon comes from. Bacon comes from a pig. - And you learned where milk comes from. Milk comes from the udder of a cow. - Would you like to know where eggs come from? I would as soon that remain a
ga840831 -- mystery.
ga840901 -- Do you know what worries me, Garfield? - My grandfather was bald, my dad is bald and my brother is balding. Not to worry. - You are probably adopted.
ga840902 -- Garfield, when we get to the campsite, what's the first thing you'd like to do? Go home. - Here we are, boys. We're camping miles from nowhere. I'd say we're closer than that. - CLICK - Oh no! Odie locked himself in the car! The poor little
ga840902 -- guy could suffocate! I think I'm starting to enjoy camping. - Unlock the door, boy. Unlock the door. Breathe deeply, boy. - Something just occurred to me. Could it be...? Could it be, Odie isn't as stupid as he looks?
ga840903 -- Pwoooock, pwock, pwock, pwock. - - Don't look, Stretch! It's not a pretty sight!
ga840904 -- Pwoooock, pwock, pwock, pwock. - PUKUCK! PUKUCK! PUKUCK! - My rubber friend, Stretch, objects to your cannibalistic ways. I'd like to have just one meal in peace.
ga840905 -- Garfield, do you know how silly you look carrying that stupid rubber chicken around all the time? - FFFFF - Uh-oh, fella. Now you did it. You made Stretch mad.
ga840906 -- Are you in there, Garfield? - There ain't nobody here but us chickens. - I WILL NOT SPEAK TO YOUR RUBBER CHICKEN! Think of Stretch as my social secretary.
ga840907 -- Here, Stretch, have an apple. - - STOMP! POO! DONG!
ga840908 -- Okay, guys, get on your mark, get st, go! - - Competition is apparently not a driving force in their lives.
ga840909 -- Hello, I'm Nermal, the... "The world's cutest kitten." I know, I know. - Why, hello, Nermal. Aren't you cute. - I want some attention, too. BONK - Aw, poor little guy! - Well, two can play the sympathy game. - CRASH! - That was one of my best
ga840909 -- plates. That was one of my best heads.
ga840910 -- I love your purr, Garfield. Purrr - I wish there were a way to get the purr without the cat. Purrr - But I guess you have to take the bad with the good. You're treading on thin ice, fella.
ga840911 -- Ready for a gourmet meal, Garfield? - WHAM! - I hate spiders.
ga840912 -- One nice thing about confiding in pets is that they are non-judgmental. - Garfield, I got a speeding ticket today. - SMACK! That was a stupid thing to do.
ga840913 -- - Why, thank you, Garfield! - PSHHH
ga840914 -- Hee, hee, there's more than one way to skin a cat. - WHIRRRRR! How prophetic.
ga840915 -- Rats, Garfield fell asleep in the middle of the door. - Have you ever tried to pick up a sleeping cat? - It's impossible.
ga840916 -- * - Good morning, Garfield. Good morning, Jon. My rubber chicken, Stretch, needs a bath too. - SPLOOSH! - Sign here for this package, mister. - PAPER! BONK - HEY, WORLD! I'M TAKING A BATH! COME ON IN AND WATCH! I'll be right back. I'm sure
ga840916 -- the man's joking, Reba.
ga840917 -- - - It's diet time, Garfield. I was afraid of that.
ga840918 -- In order to properly diet, you must change your eating habits, Garfield. - You must look at food differently. - Ha ha ha, Garfield.
ga840919 -- Let's measure your tummy, Garfield. - When you take four inches of your waist, you may go off your diet. - And that doesn't count.
ga840920 -- You may have coffee on your diet, Garfield. - Thank goodness. - This diet isn't going to be as bad as I thought.
ga840921 -- For once in my life, a diet worked. - I'm going to treat myself to a potato chip. - poomp! Rats.
ga840922 -- - Let's see how I did on my diet this week. Whimper. Oh, shut up.
ga840923 -- Good morning, sunshine, poke poke poke - Hey, Garfield, what's all this junk in your bed? - This isn't junk, this is my stuff. - I use this brass lizard to scratch my back. - And here is some extra cat hair for your food, and a double corncob
ga840923 -- that is a family heirloom. - And this is my bean-filled whack-bonk. What does that do? - WHACK! BONK
ga840924 -- It's Monday morning. A cold. gray, dizzy Monday morning. - Some dude with a trumpet is wailin' some blues on the radio and my breakfast is cold. * *  - It's all so perfectly depressing I can't wipe this smile off my face. *
ga840925 -- Hold it right there. I always want to remember you like this. - As the kind, benevolent provider. - Trying to poison me with that cat food!
ga840926 -- munch smack slurp - Uh-oh! - Quickfood.
ga840927 -- - BARK! BLUT! - Twenty years from now I'm going to look back on this and LAAAAAAUGH. rowr fffft!!
ga840928 -- What are you doing with your teddy bear, Garfield? - Pooky and I are having lunch. We do everything together. I swear. - You cats have the strangest habits.
ga840929 -- Oh, come on, Garfield. The cat food isn't that bad. - Then let's see how YOU like it! - mmm good. YOU LIE!
ga840930 -- - - - - - - I thought fat people were jolly.
ga841001 -- Look at all those poor saps trudging to work on a Monday morning. - Ha ha ha, you poor saps, you have to go to work and I don't 'cause I'm a cat! - If I weren't me, I wouldn't like me very much.
ga841002 -- It's a real rat race out there. - Everybody striving to get ahead. - I think I'll go take a nap and fall off the pace.
ga841003 -- - SUCK - He's so lazy, I could just cry. Burp
ga841004 -- I got you something special, Garfield. - It's too light for food, and you can't wrap sleep. - It can't be THAT special.
ga841005 -- Good night, Garfield. - *CLICK* Don't let the thing in the closet get you. - Don't do that to me!
ga841006 -- I think I'll try a two-and-a-half nap attack in the pike position with a half twist. - - I'll settle for a belly-flop. Z
ga841007 -- - - - - HEY, HUBERT! REBA! COME HERE, QUICK! - Play cowboy and horsy, boys. Do a handstand, Garfield. Balance on Garfield, Odie. Sad. He should get out of the house more.
ga841008 -- This feels like a great day to spend in bed. - Hop up, Garfield. We're gooing on a picnic! Give the bugs and snakes my regrets. I ain't going. - I'll get you for this, Monday!
ga841009 -- What's this? I packed the microwave for our picnic. - Well, I'm leaving it here. - WHA...! If the television stays, I stay.
ga841010 -- Wait 'til you taste my cherry pie, Garfield. It's the world's best. - I agree. - 22 million ants can't all be wrong.
ga841011 -- The picnic's all set, Garfield. - Did I forget anything? - You forgot the brick for the tablecloth.
ga841012 -- That pesky wind won't spoil our picnic now, Garfield. - Where's the mustard? - Under the third rock from the left.
ga841013 -- Well, Garfield, the ants ate my cherry pie. The wind blew the food everywhere. DON'T SAY IT! DON'T SAY IT! - What else could possibly go wrong? - You said it!
ga841014 -- MUNCH SLURP SMACK GULP - Burp. Oh, boy, I ate too much pizza. Z - SHUFFLE SHUFFLE SHUFFLE - Who are you guys? We are your pizza nightmare. - I'm the pepperoni, and these here are the onions and the anchovies. - - And who are you? I'm the
ga841014 -- matto ball you ate three weeks ago.
ga841015 --  Good morning, folks! My oh my, it's a beautiful Monday morning out there. - Our weather radar shows clear skies with no rain in sight. - Except over one house in the suburbs.
ga841016 -- Our satellite picture shows clouds over the northeast, sunny skies in the southwest... - Traffic backed up on 12th street... - And my little niece, Sally, playing in her sandbox i Texas. Kind of scary, isn't it?
ga841017 -- Wuth. - You can always tell when Odie has been eating out of the refrigerator. - He gets his tongue stuck in the ice cube trax. Wuth.
ga841018 -- GULP MUNCH SLURP - Why do you eat so much, Garfield? - In a former life I was a sanitary landfill.
ga841019 -- Clouds are so interesting. I love to find shapes in them. - There's a chicken cloud, and a hamburger cloud, and a bicycle cloud. - And I do believe that one's a rain cloud.
ga841020 -- What do you think of my new frame, Garfield? - ARRRGH! - Thank heavens! For a moment I thought it was a mirror.
ga841021 -- - - PUCUCK! - ONE MORE STUNT LIKE THAT AND I'M GOING TO WRING YOUR RUBBER CHICKEN'S NECK! - - I'm sorry I snapped at you, Garfield? Will you forgive me? I forgive you. - SMACK! WHAP! But Stretch doesn't!
ga841022 -- Here comes Arlene. She's crazy about me. - Hey, Arlene, what's my most outstanding feature? You're fat. - Did you hear that? She admires me for my body.
ga841023 -- Do you love me more than you love food, Garfield? - Do chickens have lips? - No. Bingo.
ga841024 -- Aren't you ashamed of that space between your teeth? Of course not! - It's a sign of sensitivity. - I'd be sensitive about it too. I don't know what I see in him.
ga841025 -- Don't you just love sunrise, Garfield? The chirping of the birds...the crisp morning air. - The sound of bacon sizzling in the skillet...the smell of fresh brewed coffee. - I get the feeling we're watching two different channels.
ga841026 -- Why do you like bachelorhood, Garfield? I can sum it up in a word... - "uncomplicated" - That sounds simple. Simple, that's me.
ga841027 -- What is love to you, Garfield? Love is that exhilarating feeling you get when a vision of beauty comes walking to you. - In fact, I just had that experience. When you saw me? - When I saw my mirror this morning.
ga841028 -- - - - POO! - - KONK! - The harder you work for something, the more you appreciate it.
ga841029 -- Garfield, there's a mouse in the house, and I'm just sick about it. - It chewed the toe out of my sock. - I want you to catch it and kill it. Now I'M sick about it.
ga841030 -- Good morning, mouse. Good morning, cat. - Make yourself at home. Gladly. - But first, some house rules.
ga841031 -- Hey, cat, gimme a drumstick. Sure. - Enjoy.
ga841101 -- What's your name, mouse? OK, gee. I don't think I have a name. - Oh, come on, what do people say when they meet you? - My name is Eek!
ga841102 -- We gotta give you a name, mouse. - How about Crusher? How about Bruiser? How about Cat killer? - How about Squeak? I like it.
ga841103 -- Here, Squeak, let me strap this key to your back. What's this for? - I don't remember buying you a toy mouse, Garfield. - Got the picture? You're a genius!
ga841104 -- - A dimly lit street corner at midnight. This puts me in the mood for some snappy patter. - Hey, good-lookin!. What's happening? Who are you? - Names aren't important. Some call me a soldier of fortune, some call me a renaissance man. You can
ga841104 -- call me "Major". I love men in uniform. - What say we go to Rick's Cafe Americain for a soda pop? I'm with you, big boy. - Here's lookin' at you, sweetheart. SMACK! Rats. I think I chucked her chin a little hard.
ga841105 -- Hide! Here comes my owner! - Why are we hiding? Jon wants me to eat you and I don't want to. - You're so nice! Thanks for thinking of me. I was thinking of me.
ga841106 -- Okay, Squeak, here's the game plan. Every now and then, you show up in front of Jon and dance around until I appear on the scene and chase you away. - In return, you get a nice home to live in, and I get to keep my job. - This is a strange
ga841106 -- world we live in. You gotta play by the rules.
ga841107 -- Here's your cat food, Garfield. - A MOUSE! - That must be the surprise at the bottom of the box.
ga841108 -- Hey, Squeak, I found a great place for you to live! - Jon will never think to look for you in this old log cabin. - Nice, huh? Is it in a good school system?
ga841109 -- Thanks for the house, Garfield. A man needs a place to call his own. This is great! Don't mention it, kid. - -
ga841110 -- Listen carefully, Squeak. This is a mousetrap. Never, NEVER touch the tab in the center of it. - You mean, this little tab here? - This boy does not take direction well. Hey! That hurt!
ga841111 -- - - WAH HA HA HA! - What a great sundae! Nothing can spoil my day. - SCRATCH SCRATCH - OH NO! MONDAY IS COMING!
ga841112 -- GARFIELD! COME HERE! - "Garfield" this, "Garfield" tah. I'm sick of my name. - HEY, FLEABAG! COME HERE! Then again: "Garfield" does have a certain ring on it.
ga841113 -- OH NO! A FLEA! I'M GETTING YOU A FLEA COLLAR, GARFIELD. Let's not be too hasty here. - Look at those distinctive yellow and green markings there. - This flea is a member of a rare species of vegetarians.
ga841114 -- Well, there's your new flea collar, Garfield. - Wait a minute, there's a disclaimer on this box. "Warning: while this collar will repel fleas..." - "It has been known to attract sharks."
ga841115 -- DON'T TAKE THAT FLEA COLLAR OFF, GARFIELD! Who needs it? - -
ga841116 -- You have a pretty grim flea problem there, Odie. - That's not a very strong flea collar. -
ga841117 -- Did I ever tell you about my crazy uncle Berle? He thought he was a dog. - The poor guy was always exhausted. - He kept chasing himself up trees.
ga841118 -- Can we talk? - I would like to speak to you about how wonderful cats are. - Unlike dogs, they always land on their feet. - They are more calm than dogs. ROWR! - Every movement is a deliberate statement of grace and beauty. - And when it comes
ga841118 -- to coordination, they are far superior to dogs. WHAP! - BARK ! BARK!
ga841119 -- Doc Boy! How's my favorite little brother? - Oh, things are pretty much the same here, wild parties, good times, the usual... - Uh, you say you're coming to visit? It's put up or shut up time.
ga841120 -- What am I going to do, Garfield? My brother is coming to visit from the farm. - He thinks I live life in the fast lane. "Life in the parking lot" is more like it. - I don't know where he got the idea. It was when you told him you were
ga841120 -- negotiating movie rights to your diary.
ga841121 -- There's my brother now. * DING DONG - Welcome to the big city, doc Boy! Let the good times roll! - Another soda pop? No, I think I'll have some more of that fun-filled popcorn. I'm going to like Doc Boy.
ga841122 -- I'm so embarrassed. Doc Boy comes all the way from the farm just to find out what a loser I am. The truth always hurts. - Hey, where are all those "good times" you promised me? What would you like to do? - Let's go to the airport and watch
ga841122 -- the airplanes land. Whatever you say, wild man! Jon just got off the hook.
ga841123 -- Oh, by the way, Doc Boy, I've fixed us up on a double date. HEY, GREAT! - What's a double date? That's when you and I go on a date together. - Gee, it seems like it would be more fun if some girls came along. There's no hope.
ga841124 -- DOC BOY! OUR DATES ARE HERE! - EEEEEEK! - Can we talk? Can we laugh?
ga841125 -- Z - SNORT! BLINK BLINK BLINK - Rats! It's 4 A.M. and I'm wide awake. - Fortunately, I know what to do. - CLICK - ARRRRRGH! - If I can't sleep, neither will anyone else.
ga841126 -- I wonder who that could be, Doc Boy. DING DONG . Dad! Mom! What are you doing here!? We missed you boys, okay? - A little paint, a few curtains, a woman's touch, this could be nice! My dad, the sentimental fool. My mom, the cliche.
ga841127 -- Your visit is such a surprise, mom. When's the last time you and dad went out? We haven't been off the farm since '53. I don't believe that. - Good heavens! What's this? That's an indoor toilet, dad. - WOO-HA! AIN'T SCIENCE SOMETHIN'? FLUSH
ga841127 -- NOW I believe it.
ga841128 -- - You awake, Jon? click OF COURSE NOT, DAD! IT'S 5 A.M.! WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP? - I GOTTA MILK SOMETHING! I'm leaving.
ga841129 -- You forgot this when you left home, Doc Boy. Thanks, mom, I haven't slept a wink without it. - Whatcha got there, Doc Boy? NOTHING! NOTHING! IT'S NOTHING! - Could it be a shred of your old blankie? Careful what you say about blankies,
ga841129 -- fella.
ga841130 -- Uh, mom...I wouldn't open that if I were you. - EEEK! - SOMETHING IN THERE MOVED! I'm sure it was just an optical illusion. GO ahead, tell her how the lunch meat has evolved into an intelligent life form.
ga841201 -- So long, son. We got a run. I miss my cows. Give them my best. - SEE YUH, DOC BOY! THANKS FOR DECORATING MY HOUSE, MOM! - Hello...undecorators? Jon is a man of good taste.
ga841202 -- - PILLOW FIGHT! WHAP! - You stay here. I'll be right back. - - AYIEEEEE - WHONGO! - What did you have in that pillow? I know this six-foot chicken.
ga841203 -- Garfield, I'm going to a cartoonists' convention, and the motel where I'm staying won't accept pets. - Sorry, Odie. You can't go. - Garfield, YOU are a pet. snap! Rats! I keep forgetting.
ga841204 -- I'm leaving for the cartoonists' convention now, Garfield. There's a week's worth of food for you. A week's worth, huh? - - It was more like 11 seconds' worth.
ga841205 -- I hope Jon comes back from that convention soon. - I hope I can survive this week on my own. - CLICK I hope this door isn't locked.
ga841206 -- What a tragic scenario..."Owner leaves for week...cat locks self out of house...cat starves in front porch". - Hey, wait a minute? I control my destiny! I don't have to starve on the front porch! - "Cat starves in bushes".
ga841207 -- As long as I'm locked out of the house, I guess I'll strike out in search of food. - Gee, this neighborhood doesn't look familiar to me. - Oh, no! Where am I?
ga841208 -- I gotta figure a way to meet some chicks. - You got a problem there, guy? - Striking manly poses doesn't seem to be doing it.
ga841209 -- * - * - Rats! There's an alley full of mean guys waiting to beat me up! - Maybe they won't hurt me if I look mean, too. - Hey! It's working! - - Someday, I'm going to learn precisely where that fine line is, and I'm never going to cross it
ga841209 -- again!
ga841210 -- Garfield! I'm back from the convention! Where are you, big guy? ...Garfield? - Oh, no! This is terrible! Garfield didn't get locked out or anything, did he, Odie? - Yup.
ga841211 -- Hello, Garfield. Do I know you? - Let me give you a hint...sit up straight, Don't talk with your mouth full. Wake up, sleepyhead. - MOM!
ga841212 -- It's great seeing you again, mom. Yes, it's been a while. - It seems like only yesterday. - This was your first bed. It HAS been a while.
ga841213 -- Mom, I don't recognize this place. I thought I was born in the kitchen of an Italian restaurant. It closed years ago, darling. - It's all gone! Where's the pasta? The people? The pasta? The excitement? The pasta? - You always did love to eat.
ga841213 -- Sniff...old habits are hard to break.
ga841214 -- Father, this is your grandson, Garfield. He will be staying with us for a while. - If you're going to stay here, boy, you're going to be a mouser like the rest of us. - So this is my grandson and you son, huh? Maybe they switched kittens in
ga841214 -- the maternity ward.
ga841215 -- If I have to be a mouser to stay here, grandpa, I'll do it! I have made a name for myself in the mousing game. - Then eat that mouse. ARRRGH!!! Please! Please don't make me eat it! - I'd rather swallow my pride than that mouse.
ga841216 -- RRRRR Okay, okay. Let's get something to eat. - - No cats allowed! - - - - I've been human for 10 minutes now, but I haven't forgotten my roots.
ga841217 -- Gee, I miss having Garfield around. I even miss the abuse. - RRR! - Thanks, Odie, but it just isn't the same.
ga841218 -- I'd love to catch your mice, grandpa, But I haven't seen any worthy of my time, got anything bigger? Bring on the training mouse! - - Me and my big mouth.
ga841219 -- I'm sorry I can't stay, mom. It's for the best, dear. You'd better hurry home. It's almost Christmas. - Christmas! I almost forgot! - I also forgot I'm lost.
ga841220 -- Well, this is just great. I'm cold, I'm hungry, I'm tired... - It's snowing to beat the band, and I haven't the foggiest idea where I am. - While everyone else is having a white Christmas, I'm going to have a white lost.
ga841221 -- I'm cold, I'm hungry and I'm tired. - They say, in cases like this, you should fight sleep. - I say, why fight an old friend?
ga841222 -- Garfield! Wake up! You're near home! - Huh? Mom? Wha...?! - Wow...it never looked better.
ga841223 -- - This is going to be one sad Christmas without Garfield. - SCRATCH SCRATCH SCRATCH - - BLAT! - GARFIELD! SPEAK TO ME! ARE YOU OKAY?! - Actually, yes. I just thought it would be more dramatic this way.
ga841224 -- I missed you so much, Garfield! This is going to be the best Christmas ever, because you're here. Jon? - You never realize how much you love someone until they go away. tap tap tap Jon? Jon? Jon? - What is it, Garfield? Read my lips. I'm
ga841224 -- hungry!
ga841225 -- MERRY CHRISTMAS, BOYS. - There's nothing like having the whole family together at Christmas, right? -
ga841226 -- Hey, Garfield, a late Christmas package arrived for you from my mom. OH NO! - Why, it's your annual Christmas sweater! I'll bet you thought she forgot. There was always the hope. - You should send her a "thank you" now. I'll get a letter bomb
ga841226 -- out immediately.
ga841227 -- I'll give you 10 zillion dollars for that cup of coffee. - There you go again! Every, I say, EVERY MORNING you steal my coffee. GUSH - Aw, isn't that sweet? Our little ritual.
ga841228 -- Why is it my coffee cups keep disappearing? - - AHA! I must have a word with the maid.
ga841229 -- When you own pets, you get hardened to the fact they will be around your food. - Lose something, Garfield? Nope, here's my stripe. -
ga841230 -- It's that time of year again. - This year I resolve to lose weight, exercise more and sleep less. - - Then what are you going to do after you've accomplished all that? - I suppose you're going to be nice to Odie and kowtow to Jon and lick the
ga841230 -- mailman's boots! - I DON'T LIKE YOU ALREADY. - Once again I've survived a new year with my vices intact.
ga841231 -- Hey, Garfield, get up. A new year is almost upon us! Great! Wake me next year. - Come on. I'm having a party tonight and I want you to be there. If you insist.
ga850101 -- That was some new year's celebration last night, wasn't it, Garfield? Did anyone get the license number of the party that hit me? - Are you going to get up today? No way! I got up yesterday and look what happened to me! - Not feeling well,
ga850101 -- huh? It would take two of me to feel worse.
ga850102 -- I don't mind grocery shopping. - And I don't mind carrying them home. - This is the part I dread.
ga850103 -- As long as you're in the way, why don't you find a place to put these groceries. - GOBBLE! GOBBLE! GOBBLE! - I wanted you to put them in the pantry! Urp...that can be arranged.
ga850104 -- Okay, guys, I have a new house rule. - From now on no pets are allowed on the furniture. - Harf! Harf! Harf! Wah! Ha! Ha! I don't get no respect.
ga850105 -- - One thing I love about Odie... - He's so pushoffable.
ga850106 -- I'm bored. - I'm bored, bored, bored. - Wait a minute! I control my own destiny! I'll create an exclusive country club resort. - First, I'll put some sandbox sand in the sunbeam. - Replete with the usual resort accouterments. - Hey, what a
ga850106 -- great idea! - I wonder how he got by the membership committee.
ga850107 --  Well, the holidays are finally over and the ol' waistline has explored new vistas. pat pat - It is time to declare another NATIONAL FAT WEEK. We shall tell skinny jokes and revel in our fat. - I'm talking about you, chubby.
ga850108 -- We fat people get a lot more out of life. We eat big. We drink big, we laugh big. - HAR! HAR! HAR! - Are you okay, Garfield? You wouldn't understand, skinny person.
ga850109 -- Being skinny isn't always a bed of roses. - It must be tough wearing suspenders to hold your socks up. - I knew a guy who was so skinny, he had to step on the scales twice to weight himself!
ga850110 -- I think skinny people are funny... - Their pants keep falling down. thump thump thump - I knew a kid who was so skinny, all he could wear was a hat!
ga850111 -- Don't eat that pie! It's fattening! Eat it! - You'll regret it tomorrow. Tomorrow never comes! - FLIP I'd be thinner if my conscience were quicker-witted.
ga850112 -- Fat people are healthier than skinny people in many ways... - For instance, no fat person has ever been diagnosed as having vatorphobia. - That, of course, is the fear of starving to death in a stuck elevator.
ga850113 -- This is my lucky day. - - Wha...? SCRIIICK POOF! - It grew back! - I've discovered the bottomless pan of lasagna! - BLIP - I knew it! I knew it! I knew it was too good to be true!
ga850114 -- - SLUP! - THAT WAS MY LAST CUP OF COFFEE! I spilled some. You can suck it out of my sweater.
ga850115 -- What are you watching, Garfield? I don't know. - Who's the lead character? I don't know. - What's the plot? Hey! I'm watching television! Stop making me think, okay?
ga850116 -- SLURP GULP BURP SMACK ERP - OH YUK! How disgusting! There's a people hair in my cat food!
ga850117 -- One of my pet peeves is people who never finish what they start. - I do not happen to be one of those people. - My philosophy is, "never start anything."
ga850118 -- BLAT! Oops! - Clean that up, Garfield. Patience, my friend. - There are people to do those things. ZIP!
ga850119 -- OOOOO - BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! - I'll bite. What is it? A dummy detector.
ga850120 -- - tappity tappity tappity -  tappity tappity tappity tappity tappity tappity - - BONK! - PANT PANT plunk - CLAP CLAP CLAP Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
ga850121 -- zip! - Hey! Give my napkin back! - Smile when you speak to Sumo Cat, fella.
ga850122 -- Sumo Cat has studied Sumo wrestling for years. - Sumo Cat has mastered the most dreaded tricks of his trade. - SNAP!
ga850123 -- Sumo Cat assumes the classic Sumo wrestling position. - There is only one tiny drawback to this position... - Severe cramping!
ga850124 -- Karate Cat demonstrates his art on a table leg. - HIIYAH! SNAP! - Karate Cat also demonstrates incredible lack of foresight.
ga850125 -- Most practitioners of Karate are impervious to pain. - HIIYAH! SMACK! - I happen to be of the previous to pain persuasion.
ga850126 -- For your pleasure, I, Judo Cat, will lay a basic move on this hapless bystander. - SMACK! - Leave it up to a dumb dog's rubber tongue to make a mockery of the martial arts.
ga850127 -- - Fetch the apple, Odie. - - I send Odie to fetch an apple, and he brings back an apple pie. I think I'm onto something here. - Fetch the T-bone, Odie, my boy. -
ga850128 -- Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the cutest cat of all? - Hi there. - Don't answer that.
ga850129 -- Do you know what I hate about you, Nermal? You're so one dimensional. - Oh yeah? And what dimension is that? - YOUTH!
ga850130 -- Nermal, you're cute, but you're not very bright. Doesn't that bother you? - Oh no. - I figure I'll grow out of this cute stage sooner or later. I rest my case.
ga850131 -- Nermal, would you rather have your good looks or my intellect? - My good looks. - I have years and years to get your intellect. That hurt.
ga850201 -- Nermal, would you like to be like me when you grow up? - Gosh yes! I'd like to be like you when I grow up. - And up, and up, and out, and out, and up. That boy may not see his next birthday.
ga850202 -- I gotta go, Garfield. I'm posing for a cat calendar. - How does one pose for a calendar? One moment. - That's very good. Cute is my life.
ga850203 -- Hey, Odie! Look at this! - It's snowing! Let's go out and catch snowflakes on our tongues! - - Here comes a world record! - - Ooo, that's a very impressive collection. - Surprise boys! I fixed a feast for you! No thanks. We just ate. Urp.
ga850204 -- SPLUT! - OH NO! - Yup...it's splut week.
ga850205 -- - - SPLUT!
ga850206 -- ssssssss - sssssssss - sssSSSSPLUT!
ga850207 -- Good evening, ladies and germs! - SPLUT! SPLUT! SPLUT! - Thank you for that generous round of spluts!
ga850208 -- SPLUT! - Hey, wait a minute! Shoes don't go "splut"! - SPLUT! That's more like it.
ga850209 -- I'm tired of getting hit with pies all the time. - I'm going to find whoever is doing it, and I'm going to bite him. flick - SPLUT! SPLUT!
ga850210 -- - Good morning, Garfield. Hi there. - - - WHA?! - You're everywhere at once! How do you do that? Magic. - AMAZING! Thanks, guys.
ga850211 -- Can't you close your mouth to eat? You're hard to look at. - You mean, this bothers you? Yuk! - I see no humor in that, Garfield. Then why am I chortling?
ga850212 -- A house becomes a home once it's well established with cat hair. - Oh no! This is not a cat hair! It's a whisker! - I'm going bald!
ga850213 -- You're shedding again. What am I supposed to do with all this cat hair? Knit the world's largest hairball. - Trade it with your friends, start a mustache factory. - This is going nowhere. Insulate your house! Filter your coffee!
ga850214 -- Did you know there are three kinds of cat hair? There's the common, way to clean kind... - There's the kind that disappears into the carpet, never to be seen again. And then there's my favorite... - There's the kind that hangs in the air
ga850214 -- forever. LAND! DARN IT! LAND!
ga850215 -- Well, I've swept under the furniture, vacuumed my chair and shaken the rugs. I'm finally rid of all your cat hair. - - Fortunately, I keep an emergency supply in the back of my bed.
ga850216 -- You boys sure shed a lot. - Wha?! SHOOP! - The cat hair refuses to associate with the dog hair. sniff..
ga850217 -- DINNER TIME, GARFIELD! - I ran out of canned cat food. I'm sure you know what to do with this dried stuff. - I certainly do.  - - WHOAAA! - Enjoying your cat food, Garfield? We must have it more often.
ga850218 -- WHIRRR! - FWUMP! WHAT WAS THAT?! - Hi, Squeak! Get me out of here!
ga850219 -- How are you, Squeak? How would you feel if you got sucked up in a vacuum cleaner? - How humiliating! Me, a mouse, sucked up like a common piece of dirt. That's just my luck! What are the chances of that ever happening? - whirrrr SHOOP!
ga850219 -- Getting better all the time, I'd say.
ga850220 -- Hey, Garfield, I'm missing a slipper, two spools of thread and a button... - You don't know where they are, would you? I think I do... - May I have a word with you, Squeak? Vroom! Vroom!
ga850221 -- Why are people afraid of mice? Bad press, I guess. - Maybe it's because mice carried the black plague in 1348. I don't know what you're talking about. - As I recall, half of Europe died. - Picky, picky, picky.
ga850222 -- Would you look at that mousetrap?! Barbaric, isn't it. - You said it! A nice camembert or creamy brie would be worth going in after. - BUT THAT PROCESSED AMERICAN CHEESE IS AN INSULT TO MY PALATE! Precisely what I was saying.
ga850223 -- You're lazy, Garfield. Lazy, do you hear me? If you had any ambition, you could be anything you want. - Like the world's greatest mouser? - Lazy, I admire that in a cat.
ga850224 -- - Hmmm - click click - Okay, your move. - - GARFIELD! - How many times have I told you not to play with your food?
ga850225 -- Hey, Garfield, what say we have potatoes for dinner? - Gee, it's been a long time since I fixed potatoes. - Tell me about it.
ga850226 -- Trivia time, Garfield! - What's the only substance on earth harder than a diamond? - Your leftover pizza.
ga850227 -- I have just taken an inventory of your refrigerator. - !89 bottles of salad dressing with 1" in the bottom of each. 14 half empty bottles of catsup, 39 open cans of flat soda pop and 62 bread wrappers with the heels. - ORGANIZE YOURSELF!
ga850227 -- SMACK!
ga850228 -- EEEEK! - Clean your refrigerator out, Jon! The mystery meat crawled out of the tinfoil and snapped at me!
ga850301 -- knock knock Who's there? - Uhhh...candy gram? You can't fool me, mystery meat. You want out to wreak havoc. - Today the refrigerator, tomorrow the world!
ga850302 -- - I wonder if I should clean the refrigerator. - The bacon is gazing on the lettuce and he asks if the refrigerator needs cleaning.
ga850303 -- OH NO! - GARFIELD! YOU'RE SITTING IN MY SCRAMBLED EGGS! They're warm. - Okay, okay, here...enjoy. - NO, go ahead and sit in them, they're ruined now. RUINED? - JUST BECAUSE I STAY IN 'EM, IT'S NOT LIKE YOUR STUPID SCRAMBLED EGGS ARE DISEASED,
ga850303 -- YOU KNOW! - UNNNGH! EAT 'EM! EAT 'EM! - HUBERT! THE CAT'S FEEDING JON! Pack your bags, Reba! We're moving for sure this time!
ga850304 -- It's time for your checkup, Garfield. I'll get checked-up while the lady vet gets checked out. - We gotta make sure you're in good condition. Right. - The only condition he's worried about is his glandular condition.
ga850305 -- Good morning, Mr. Arbuckle. - How did you know it was me? I wasn't even in the door yet! you have a distinctive cologne. - Oh, you mean my ''Ode De Lumberjack"? Bingo.
ga850306 -- How about a date, doc? Oh, let's not and say we did. - That's better than nothing, I guess. - Can we say I kissed you good night? If we can say I slapped you.
ga850307 -- Let's be honest with one another, Liz. - I'm a man. You're a woman. Get the picture? - That's the door. Get the picture? You'll have to draw it for him, doc.
ga850308 -- Do you think these shaders make me more mysterious? YOU don't need them. - Hey, good-lookin', what time do you get off work? - You just propositioned my coat rack. He might get lucky this time.
ga850309 -- In case you're thinking about asking me out, doc, forget it. I have plans. - I'm seeing this girl, ho is real cute and real clever and we laugh a lot. Do tell... - My, my, my! Do I detect a note of jealousy in your voice? I walked into that
ga850309 -- one?
ga850310 -- Sigh. - Garfield, you are worthless. Do you know that? - You are doing zero with your life...zip. Do you know that? poke poke - You should learn something new each day. It would lend purpose to this dreary existence of yours. - I'm going to
ga850310 -- the store. When I come back, I want you to have learned something. - I'm home, Garfield. Did you learn anything? - I learned how to use your credit card.
ga850311 -- Ah ah ahhhh! Don't touch that dial. We'll be right back. - -

ga850318 -- SURF'S UP! SURF'S UP! - Garfield the Surfer King hangs three. - You're acting strangely lately, Garfield. You live in your world, I'll live in mine.
ga850319 -- Garfield, the vet says you are going to have to stay inside. There's a rare strain of Hawaiian cat flu going around. - - Too late, doc.
ga850320 -- Garfield, the vet says the Hawaiian cat flu will give you a voracious appetite and make you listless and cranky. - - I guess we'll never know if you're sick or not! I saw that one coming.
ga850321 -- Garfield, you have the Hawaiian cat flu. You're going to have to lie around all week. Oh, darn. - And you must stay inside. WHAT?! - For the first time in my life, I gotta get out!
ga850322 -- Garfield, I know you are suffering from the Hawaiian cat flu, but you look ridiculous doing that hula dance. - Watch my hands carefully, Jon. - Every movement has a meaning! BONK!
ga850323 -- You look much better this morning. You must be over the Hawaiian cat flu. I doubt that I ever had it. - What would you like for breakfast? Just some juice and a Danish. - And a roast pig! And six pineapples! And a pound of Macadamia nuts!

ga850330 -- There's only one drawback to an assertive lifestyle. - CRASH! - Sometimes you get the bear, and sometimes the bear gets you.
ga850331 -- - Here, Garfield. Eat! CLOMP! - Just look at you! You're a fright! - I get up early and groom myself because this is our special time together! - And the only place you take me is for granted! - - Are you trying to tell me something,
ga850331 -- Garfield? I'm just showing you what happens when the magic goes out of our relationship.
ga850401 -- The mailman is going to rue the day he put on that silly uniform when he opens Jon's mailbox today. - Boy, is he going to be surprised. - Boy, am I stuck.
ga850402 -- Here I am, Garfield the cat, doomed to spend the rest of my days in this stupid mailbox. What a cruel twist of fate. - HEY, FATE! HERE'S WHAT I THINK OF YOU! - PLPLPL
ga850403 -- Leave it up to me to get stuck in this mailbox. So much for my ambush attempt on the mailman. - Here he comes now! -
ga850404 -- * - Thanks, Garfield. - I can see the headlines now. "Cat stuck in mailbox somehow manages to severely injure local man."

ga850409 -- * - rrrrrrr - Oh, listen, Jon! They're playing our song! SHOOMP!
ga850410 -- Garfield, you eat like a pig. You should chew your food 25 times before swallowing. - Right. I'll give it a shot...just one thing... - What's chew?
ga850411 -- It's fun to find familiar shades in the clouds. - There's an old standard. - A dog cloud chasing a a cat cloud up a tree cloud.
ga850412 -- Good morning, morning. - What a great day to be alive. - I'd even go so far as to say it's a great day to be awake.
ga850413 -- Hey, Garfield. Hey, Odie. I have a little piece of leftover steak. Who - SHOOM! - wants it?

ga850416 -- - - Don't even think about it.
ga850417 -- A lot of people don't like fish. You can't hug them. You can't take them for a walk on a leash. - They have no sense of humor and all they do is eat and sleep. - Wait a minute! I just described me!
ga850418 -- Come here, you. - PLOOP - What are you doing with my goldfish, Garfield? Would you believe I was trying to kiss it good night?
ga850419 -- OH NO! - DON'T LOCK ME UP! I'LL BE GOOD! I SWEAR! - Oh.
ga850420 -- I've decided to let you live, little fella. - Oh sure, you're probably thinking way down deep I'm a mister nice guy... - Well, set one fin out that cage and you're history.

ga850422 -- I think I'll get today started off on the right foot. pat pat - PUNT! . My heart says "yes", but, my right foot said, "no".
ga850423 -- Hey, Garfield! Come and get it! Come and get "it", he says. - Just what is an "it"? Is "it" a hamburger? Is "it" cat food? - Nope, "it" is just an "it".
ga850424 -- ODIE! DON'T CHASE CARS! YOU COULD GET CLOBBERED! YIP! YIP! YIP! - Clobbered? - Hey, Odie! Here comes a Buick that said unkind things about your mother!

ga850426 -- Surprise, Garfield! I made you some weenie gelatin! - gobble slurp smack gulp - Well, what do you think? My mouth liked it, but my stomach is still making up its mind.
ga850427 -- Get off the curtains, Garfield. Why? - Get off the curtains or I'll have you declawed. - You just can't argue with logic.
ga850428 -- It's time to get up. - It's time to gorge myself. - It's time to kick the dog. PUNT! - It's time for a nap ion front of the television. - It's time to eat my afternoon fern. - It's time for my 14-hour beauty rest. I'm a creature of

ga850429 -- Hey, Judy! How are you, cuz? Yeah, we'll be home. Come on over. - Sure, bring the kids, too. - Garfield? Tierra del Fuego
ga850430 -- My cousin Judy is coming to visit and she's bringing her children. - So put everything you value out of reach. -
ga850501 -- Hi, Judy! How are you, cousin? - And this must be Tammy. YOOOOOO! IT STINKS HERE! IT SMELLS LIKE A CAT! - Sniff, sniff, yoooo! Where's that kid smell coming from?
ga850502 -- Garfield, this is my cousin Judy and her children, Tammy and Stevie. - BALL! BALL! - Oh, listen! Stevie's first words! And his last.
ga850503 -- Do you know why I don't like kids? - I'll give you three guesses. - And the first two don't count.
ga850504 -- Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. - THERE HE IS! - I'm sure your mother has told you not to play with sharp objects.
ga850505 -- z z z - Yup! - I'm glad I'm not a bird. - All they ever do is eat worms and sit in the birdbath. - They never have any fun. - -
ga850506 -- Lucky me. Jon's cousin Judy comes to visit and she brings her two yard apes, Tammy and Stevie. - They're basically good kids, I guess. - For werewolves.
ga850507 -- I like to hang around babies at mealtime. They drop all kinds of good food. - - Sometimes they need encouragement.

ga850513 -- - Rats! I always run out of milk before I run out of cookie!
ga850514 -- - BOING! - You should warn me when you put in the screen door!
ga850515 -- We cats are special. We are built to sense things about humans even they don't know. - - Your feet stink.
ga850516 -- - That's a pretty funky dance, Garfield. Show me how you do it. - First, find a bur in your sandbox.
ga850517 -- We're going to the vet, Garfield. I wonder what she'll remove this time. - Any last words? My uncle Patrick's famous quote comes to mind. - "I regret that I have but nine lives to give to my country".
ga850518 -- I love this time of year. There's the first bluebird. - There's the first daisy. - DONK - There's the first rake in the face.
ga850519 -- Come here, Garfield. I have something to tell you. - I'm going to organize my sock drawer today. This is a red-letter day! - I'm going to put the black ones on one end and the white ones on the other. Decisions! Decisions! Decisions! - And do
ga850519 -- you know what I might do after that? Oh no! Spare me! Spare me! - I might tighten the hinges on my reading glasses. ARRRGH! - OH WHEN WILL THIS MAD, CRAZY, MERRY-GO-ROUND EXISTENCE EVER END? - Or I might give a certain wise guy cat a bath.
ga850519 -- I'll tuck, you sort.
ga850520 -- Mornin', hon. Mornin', Irma. - Say when. - When. These people need help.
ga850521 -- HEY! WHERE'S THE WAITRESS IN THIS CRUMMY DIVE?! THE SERVICE HERE STINKS! WHO'S THE MANAGER HERE ANYWAY?! You are. - SMACK! Forgot. I'm going home. smack!
ga850522 -- TWO EGGS SCRAMBLED, PIGS IN BLANKET, AND GIVE IT WINGS! - ZIP! - Two eggsa scrambled! Pigs in a blanket! Pronto! This is a small operation. We should kill it before it spreads.
ga850523 -- Do you know what I like about your place, Irma? You're open 24 hours. - - I'm giving serious consideration to taking on an assistant.
ga850524 -- I don't see how you do it, Irma. - How do you keep this place open 24 hours with no help? - Z Now I see how she does it. Sheer willpower.
ga850525 -- Here's your egg, hon. Whatever you do, try not to think about where it came from. - - Have an egg, Garfield. Too late. I already thought about it.
ga850526 -- Boy, am I starved. - Here y'are, hon. Thanks, Irma. - - Uh, Irma. - Don't mind me, hon. - I think I lost a false eyelash in here somewhere. - Sardi's this ain't.
ga850527 -- I think I'll exercise. - I'd better start slowly. - Today I shall attempt to register a pulse.
ga850528 -- KABONG! KABONG! KABONG! KABONG! Garfield, get out of here! - And take your pogo stick with you!
ga850529 -- Let's talk about the responsibilities an owner assumes when he obtains a cat. The first responsibility is to feed that cat. - LATER! - I guess we'll wait to discuss the second responsibility when we're in a little better mood.
ga850530 -- Hey, Garfield, here's an article about a guy who thought he could fly by wearing a cape and jumping off a building. - They scraped him off Fifth Avenue with a putty knife. I guess he learned his lesson. - Yeah, he didn't believe.
ga850531 -- Good morning, Job. Hmmph - SMACK! BLUT! - I'm feeling good about today so don't burst my bubble, okay?
ga850601 -- Oh goody! Jon's home! - - When Mr. Excitement steps into the room, you can cut the apathy with a knife.
ga850602 -- Hmmm - All cats are innately curious. I was just wondering where rainwater goes. - WHOA! - - Gasp! - So this is where rainwater goes! Interesting! - So this is where dishwater goes! Fascinating. So this is where bathwater goes! That's the
ga850602 -- last time I drink out of the toilet.
ga850603 -- Good morning, Garfield. Mmmph. - What was that? Mmmph. - I can't understand you. I ate all the ice cream and my mouth went numb, okay?
ga850604 -- Sniff - Remember, as you walk down the path of life... - Stop and eat the flowers along the way.
ga850605 -- What's the difference between flowers and weeds? - STOMP! STOMP! STOMP! - Weeds have a greater will to live.
ga850606 -- - Hey, Jon! - When was the last time you swept under the bed?
ga850607 -- Surprise, Garfield! - I picked up lunch at grease world! - Junk food is the staff of life.
ga850608 -- - kiss - Pets always sense when you're going to the grocery. Buy me a steak.
ga850609 -- - Look at Jon's socks, they are all perfectly tucked and organized. - Okay, socks, line up! Count off! - FORWARD HARCH! ONE! TWO! THREE! FOURP! - Stay away from my sock drawer, Garfield. You make me nervous. - - As you were.
ga850610 -- - - Clear your head, Jon. There has to be a logical explanation for this, other than the teddy bear isn't housebroken.
ga850611 -- Pick up your stuff, Garfield. STUFF?! Pooky isn't STUFF! He's a real, live, feeling, breathing... - Uh...inanimate object.
ga850612 -- That sun is pretty strong today, Pooky. A guy could burn if he's not careful. - -
ga850613 -- Do you know why I love Pooky? - It is said we were given two ears and only one mouth so that we can tell only half of what we hear... - Pooky has two ears and no mouth.
ga850614 -- So, this is the bedtime story you want to hear, huh? - "Bangor the Enforcer screamed, 'The world is ours!' at that very moment teddy bears everywhere crawled out of their toy chests and armed themselves". - This is a side of teddy bears I'd
ga850614 -- as soon not know.
ga850615 -- And then about April of '81 or was it '82, my voice changed and I started singing the baritone part. - Gee, Pooky. I'm tired of talking about me... - YOU talk about me for a while.
ga850616 -- Persons At Work - How fortuitous, someone was kind enough to dig this hole for me. - I'll cover it with these branches and play a little trick on Odie. - Hey, Odie, have a bone. - BOING! - Something's not right here. - OH NO! IT'S THE OLD
ga850616 -- RUBBER HOLE GAG!
ga850617 -- This sun is enough to bake your brains. - - That, of course, doesn't affect Odie.
ga850618 -- It must be a zillion degrees out there, Garfield. - Let's turn on the radio and find out what the temperature is. - You mean this radio?
ga850619 -- - SURPRISE! - Happy birthday, Garfield! I had a feeling this was coming.
ga850620 -- Observe, beating the heat is simply a matter of mind over body. - I'm cold. I'm cold. I'm cold. - Unfortunately, my body has a mind of its own.
ga850621 -- - -
ga850622 -- Have some lemonade, Garfield. - GUSH! - Refreshed? Yo.
ga850623 -- Sleeping, we do more of it than anything else in life, and know very little about it. - Welcome to the "Wonderful World Of 'Sleep". Today we will examine fascinating sleeping positions. - Z Jon here is demonstrating the classic fetal
ga850623 -- position. - Odie is in your basic armchair poily position. Z - When you sleep as much as I do, you crave variety in your attitudes of repose. - For your edification, I shall now attempt the world's most bizarre sleeping position! - Z oooo
ga850624 -- Hey, all you turkeys! You have to go to work and I don't! - - Spare time would be more fun if I had less to spare.
ga850625 -- I love lying on the sill watching the rain. - KA-BOOM! - I love lying under the bed listening to the rain.
ga850626 -- - -
ga850627 -- What do you suppose the chances are of me leaping from this sill and having the window slam shut on my tail? - SLAM! - Do I know me or what?
ga850628 -- Most cats would be angry hanging by the tail from a window. - But not me. - I'M FURIOUS!
ga850629 -- Let me get you out of the window, Garfield. - There you go. BONK! - I don't know whether to thank Jon, or kill him.
ga850630 -- Shoo-doop boowa, shoo-doop boowa. - Well I was workin' last night on my piston head, when my best friend told me my girl was dead. - Well, I'll sure, I'll sure, I'll sure - I'll sure, I'll sure, I'll sure, I'll sure, I'll sure, I'll sure -
ga850630 -- KA-CHUNK I'll sure - miss herrrrr.
ga850701 -- This tree is tempting me to climb it, but I'm standing my ground this time. - YOU WHAT?! - I can't resist a double dare.
ga850702 -- I'll get out of this tree sooner or later. Cats always do. - No cat has ever lived his whole life up a tree. - I have. You stay out of this.
ga850703 -- What's your name? Ed. - Now let me get this straight, Ed. You say you've never been on the ground? - What's ground? I see...
ga850704 -- Come clean, Ed. You can't tell me you've never been on the ground. That's impossible. - Maybe you're right. - Mom, have I ever been on the ground? What's ground?
ga850705 -- Garfield, I'd like you to meet my twin brother, Ted. - Ed! Ted is a squirrel! - No wonder mother always liked him best!
ga850706 -- This is just great. Here I am stuck up a tree with a cat who's been raised by squirrels. - SQUAWK! - Now what are you doing? Storing birds for the winter.
ga850707 -- Let's see, it's over and under, then through. - I'm taking you out to eat, Garfield. You'll have to wear this to get into the restaurant. - I'll have a steak and my ca...er...son will have a triple order of lasagna and a cup of cocoa. - This
ga850707 -- is an exclusive restaurant, Garfield. Use your silverware. GULP! SLURP! GULP! - That marshmallow is meant for your cocoa. - Heh, heh. Don't lick your paws at the table, son. - That's the rudest little kid I've ever seen! He even shed on the
ga850707 -- tablecloth.
ga850708 -- Can you imagine a cat being raised by squirrels? I gotta get Ed out of this tree before it's too late. - Too late for what? - Never mind.
ga850709 -- It's time we get out of this tree, Ed. How do we do that? - CRACK! - Funny you should ask.
ga850710 -- Welcome to your first step on earth, Ed! What do you think? - Wow! Wild! Weird! - What are you doing? I've never walked sideways sideways before.
ga850711 -- Well, Ed, what do you think of your first trip out of your tree? - Ed? - I think I have a fear of low places.
ga850712 -- Since you've been raised by squirrels, Ed, you have a lot to learn about being a cat. - What is that? That is a dog. Cats are afraid of dogs. - What? I have forgotten.
ga850713 -- I gotta go home, Garfield. What for? - I miss mother, the squirrel. You're weird, Ed. - You're lucky, too.
ga850714 -- - King Cattaeatalotta gives a peace offering to the volcano that claimed young princess Angora. - Up against the wall, you crumbums, or I'll give your backsides a taste of my daisy! - Make love, not dog pounds. - Here, my dear, perhaps this
ga850714 -- will will make up for leaving you alone to fend off the border guards. - AHEE AH-EE AH! - WHAT HAPPENED TO MY FLOWER BED?! Scuttlebutt at the precinct is that your daisies were vandalized by an overactive imagination.
ga850715 -- Ha, ha, ha! I love my new Monday suit. CLANK CLANK - Nothing can get me now. CLANK - CREAK Except possibly rust.
ga850716 -- Something is not right here. - WHAM! I knew it!!! - Today is Monday cleverly disguised as Tuesday.
ga850717 -- There's nothing more annoying than a leaky faucet. DRIP DRIP DRIP - DRIP DRIP DRIP DRIP - DRIP DRIP DRIP Unless it's a leaky dog.
ga850718 -- DRIP DRIP DRIP DRIP - DRIP DRIP DRIP Come here, Odie. - DRIP DRIP DRIP Let me tighten your gasket.

ga850720 -- Look at those cars out there, Garfield. What a fascinating assemblage. - All those people in their tiny steel universes, moving to the choreography of the traffic light. - What are your observations on the subject, Garfield? 17 blue ones have
ga850720 -- gone by 11 red ones.
ga850721 -- - Hey, Garfield! It's going to be a beautiful day! Let's spend it outside! - Where are my swim trunks? - There's suntan lotion in here somewhere. - And now a picnic lunch! - PERFECT DAY, HERE WE COME! - Rats. Missed it.
ga850722 -- Ladies and gentlemen, for your entertainment pleasure, I've added music to my act. - I am proud to introduce the man with the plan from the street with the beat. - Mr. Skins!

ga850728 -- Ooch! Eech! Ouch! - - Hot, hot, hot. It's hot out there. - It's too hot to move. It's too hot to think, It's just too hot. - - rrr ft - Garfield! Odie! - Stop fighting.
ga850729 -- Here you are, Garfield. I call it "Breakfast Surprise". - BLAT! - If I wanted a surprise, I'd eat in the dark.
ga850730 -- - - It's times like this I wish Odie could talk.
ga850731 -- Do you want something to eat, boys? BARK! BARK! - Do you? Huh? huh? YIP! YIP! BARK! - The word "dignity" is not in a dog's vocabulary.
ga850801 -- I am cat, hear me roar, I am too big to ignore. SNAP! - - Perhaps I should consider a career change.
ga850802 -- - - It's shorts weather.
ga850803 -- BARK! - Hey, Odie. Come back here. - Do that again. I can still hear a little out of this ear.
ga850804 -- Oh yuk! A spider! - Hold still, spider, while I squash you with this window. - SLAM! tinkle tinkle - PLOP! - CRASH! - KA-BOOM! - Rats! Missed it.
ga850805 -- Look what you did to that chair, Garfield, You're too fat. - I am not too fat. They just don't make chairs the way they used to. - They don't make doors the way they used to either.
ga850806 -- Garfield, you wouldn't be fat if your eyes weren't larger than your stomach. - - THAT'S JUST AN EXPRESSION!
ga850807 -- Garfield, I'm putting you on a diet. ARRRGH! - I know you hate diets. If you can think of a better way to lose weight, I'm willing to listen. - Amputate something!
ga850808 -- Ah, there is nothing more refreshing than a leaf of fresh lettuce for the wight conscious. - Thank you so much for the delightful diet, Jon. - Where are you going? - I'm going to die now.
ga850809 -- - There's an interesting bit of diet trivia. - A pie cut into tiny slices has fewer calories than an entire pie.

ga850819 -- Z - HEY! - When there's napping to do around here, I'LL do it.
ga850820 -- You're late for dinner, Garfield. - I assume you have a good excuse. - My morning nap raged out of control.
ga850821 -- Rats. - I hate it when this happens to me. - Daytime insomnia.
ga850822 -- - - I FELL ASLEEP ON MY TENNIS RACKET, OKAY?! Oh.
ga850823 -- There must be millions of ants down there. - I wonder how you tell the difference between boy ants and girl ants. - I guess they didn't have any trouble figuring it out.
ga850824 -- Hey, bug. You're ugly. - You're creepy. - You're history. SQUIK
ga850825 -- * - Eat me. - I can't eat you. You're Jon's favorite fern. What are fronds for? - I might get in trouble. Aw, come on. Take one little taste. You'll like me. - - MUNCH CHOMP MUNCH CHOMP - GARFIELD! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! Just trying to make
ga850825 -- everybody happy. Thank you.
ga850826 -- Gee, Jon's pancakes sure look good. - I'd love to take them from him, but I'm not that kind of guy. - But the Caped Avenger is!
ga850827 -- The Lone Ranger has Tonto, the Green Hornet has Kato, and Batman has Robin. The Caped Avenger needs a sidekick too. - - Then again, I may go this a capella.
ga850828 -- As the new sidekick of the Caped Avenger, you need a neat name. What shall I call you? - SLURP - Come along, "Slurp".
ga850829 -- Slurp, as the Caped Avenger's sidekick, you need a costume. - - You've missed the point.
ga850830 -- Okay, Slurp, go out and find a costume befitting the sidekick of the Caped Avenger. - - Rule number one: never dress better than the hero. slap slap slap
ga850831 -- Here comes my sidekick, Slurp. - CRASH! - Hey, Slurp, maybe you should cut some eyeholes in your mask.
ga850901 -- Z - Z - Rats! I'm hungry. I always wake up in the middle of the night hungry. Oh well, let's look around. - Hello, what's this? It feels like a big old loaf of pumpernickel. - YIP! Sorry about that, Odie. - All right! Olives! I love Olives! I
ga850902 -- like to suck the pimentos out first and then nibble on the green part till it's gone. - SHUP - I assume there's a logical explanation for this. CLICK I'm so embarrassed.
ga850903 -- Slurp, our mission in life is to seek out evil wherever it may lurk. - LOOK! - I'll bet there's some leftover evil in that refrigerator.
ga850904 -- Now that I have a sidekick, I can get into all sorts of trouble and he will protect me. - Hey, dog, your mother chases garbage trucks. SMACK - What do you mean, you resign your commission?
ga850905 -- The Caped Avenger sees a door that must be broken down. - Slurp, take that door out! - I love sidekicks. They do all the painful stuff.

ga850907 -- Oh no! My blanket's not here! How am I going to be the Caped Avenger today? - Maybe Jon's got something. - Somehow I don't think the "Paisley Avenger" is going to cut it.
ga850908 -- Pet Shop - Look at all those poor animals in there all caged up. This looks like a job for... - Freedom Fighter! - YOU'RE FREE! YOU'RE FREE! - GO FOR IT! - Hmmm, folks must not be heavily into freedom these days. - You're secure! You're

ga850910 -- Well, guys, there's one thing we need before we go into the movie. SNACKS! - I'd like the banana-flavored tooth busters, the flaming mouth things, the triple-buttered nut clusters and three pumpkin fizz sodas. - That will be $89.50 Uh, how
ga850910 -- about some popcorn? With the barbecue sauce.
ga850911 -- - I probably shouldn't ask this, but where did Odie get the bubble gum? - PLOP! Don't ask, and don't look under the seats.
ga850912 -- - - Cut that out.
ga850913 -- - Where are you going? The movie isn't over yet. - The movie is over when the popcorn is finished.
ga850914 -- Why did we waste our evening at that movie? - And why was the photography so bad? - And why did they hand me three pairs of 3-D glasses?
ga850915 -- GARFIELD! IT'S TRIPLE-COUPON DAY AT THE SUPERMARKET. WE GOTTA HURRY! - Here it is, triple-coupon day at the market. Shoppers are lined up and eagerly awaiting the opening of the store. - There's the green flag! - As the pack backs up behind

ga850918 -- I have some bad news, Garfield. I ran out of your favorite cat food. I'll survive. - Odie chewed up your scratching post. Big deal. - And Frank left Marcia for Stephanie. HOW COULD HE?!
ga850919 -- There's a mouse in the house. What are you going to do about it? - Lighten up, Jon. How much can one little mouse eat? - Can we talk? Nngh!
ga850920 -- Well, guys, it's time for the late night fright movie. - Remember, Odie. It's your turn this week. - Tell us when we can look again.

ga850924 -- - rrr SNAP! - WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!
ga850925 -- * - Static electricity is a wonderful thing.
ga850926 -- Hey, Odie. - Do me a favor, will you. - Thanks.
ga850927 -- - GOOSH! - Just as I thought. It's just eyeballs and a bow.
ga850928 -- Hey, dog, how about some pepper to go with that tail. - WAH-CHOO! - Gesundheit.
ga850929 -- Ouch - SWISH SWISH - There's something about carrying a stick that gives one a feeling of authority. - Fiy my dinner! Get a haircut! Clean up that mess! poke - Get some exercise! Make your bed! Lose weight! - The bigger the stick, the greater

ga851001 -- Hey, Odie, where's your lucky special stick? - - Everyone needs a luck special stick.
ga851002 -- - TAP TAP TAP TAP TAP Hey, Jon, my lucky special stick wants you to get up and fix my breakfast! - A loyal friend, the lucky special stick.
ga851003 -- Dogs can't hurt me as long as I carry my lucky special stick. - - Of course, sometimes I have to carry it pretty fast.
ga851004 -- You're not going to believe this. - - When was the last time you saw a stick retrieve a dog?
ga851005 -- Nothing can harm me as long as I have my lucky special stick - SNAP! - They don't make lucky special sticks like they used to.
ga851006 -- - I'm going to take a nap now, Nermal. If you so much as touch my food, I'll squash you flat, okay? - KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK - Who are you? Don't you remember? I'm Nermal, the kitten you tried to starve a few years ago. - I came back to replay old
ga851006 -- unkindness! WHAP! WHAP! POOF! - Here you go, little buddy. Enjoy, enjoy! - I must be dreaming.
ga851007 -- Garfield, you're sleeping your life away. - There's a whole world out there for the taking. - Great. Have it sent to my bed.
ga851008 -- - -
ga851009 -- Boy, am I bored. I'm so bored I have nothing better to do than lie here flat as a pancake. - A big fluffy pancake dripping with butter and maple syrup. - Boy, am I hungry.
ga851010 -- Jon, here's something I feel I should tell you, because you're going to find out anyway. - You know how much Odie drools. - I had to sandbag his tongue.
ga851011 -- - There are hugs and there are hugs. - But, there are no hugs like bear hugs.
ga851012 -- CLONK - I hate that when the coaster sticks to my glass then falls onto the table! - Garfield, cud I haff a wud wif you?
ga851013 -- - Garfield, you watch too much television. Probably. - You could be doing much better things with your time than staring at a TV set. That's for sure. - There's a whole world out there to experience. I imagine so. - Uh, you could be, ...uh,
ga851013 -- you could, uh. - Why would someone wear a Llama suit? Bests me. - What are we watching? Trivia Bingo.
ga851014 -- Surprise! I got you a canopy bed! Allright! - - I feel like a Sissy.
ga851015 -- YAWN - WHA?! - These canopy beds take some getting used to.
ga851016 -- - - Are you ashamed of your new bed, Garfield? What gives you that idea?
ga851017 -- Jon finally got me a bed with some class. - But it's just not me. I have my pride. - And pride, of course, is the middle class substitute for class.
ga851018 -- - CLICK - And just what are you doing? I had this incredible urge to take inventory.
ga851019 -- - - LIAR!
ga851020 -- It knows where I am. - I know it's here. I can feel its presence. - There's no escaping it. - Once it has you, you're a goner! - Run for it, Garfield! - Here it comes again! - YOU WON'T TAKE ME WITHOUT A FIGHT. - ARRRGH! - Another victim of a

ga851024 -- Jump onto the pillow, Nermal! - BLAT! - You did that on purpose, did you? I do everything on purpose.
ga851025 -- You don't have to play with that pathetic little ball of yarn, Nermal, I'll get my personal ball of yarn for you. - How nice! - Maybe Garfield likes me after all!
ga851026 -- Answer me this... - Why is it when they say an adult has the "mind of a child," they lock him up? - While children are allowed to run free in the streets?
ga851027 -- - Well, well, well. Odie's sitting in front of the recliner. Let's have some fun, shall we? - Watch this. - - WHUMP! WHAP! - I hate to brag, but it took a brilliant mind to figure that gag out. - SMACK!
ga851028 -- - KLANG! - Okay! Okay! You didn't have to shout.
ga851029 -- Let me tell you about my Monday. Monday was going great. I thought it was going to be the first Monday of my life that didn't stink. - I got up in the middle of the night and ate some jawbreakers. - Then I woke up this morning and my marble
ga851029 -- collection was missing!
ga851030 -- Hey, Garfield! I just bought a Swiss army knife. It does about a million things! Sure! - I've seen those knives before. They're about as useless as... - FOOMP! That's a new one on me.
ga851031 -- Jon, I have decided my living area is a mite drab. - I have some plans to spiff it up a bit. - What? No servant's quarters? Why, of course, silly! Right over there behind the pool.
ga851101 -- Z Gee, I wish we could get better reception on the television. - - Z Better.
ga851102 -- Garfield, begging for food is not going to get you anything to eat. - Throwing a tantrum is not going to get you anything to eat. WAH! - Now you're getting somewhere.
ga851103 -- - Many of you have probably noticed you wake up in the morning a pound or two lighter then when you went to bed. - Now, just where does all that weight go? - I'm here to tell you that the atmosphere around us is filled with the fat of
ga851103 -- sleeping people! - Furthermore, there are senders and there are receivers. We fat people gain weight simply by inhaling. - Now, we sure as heck aren't going to stop breathing. - So why don't you skinny people do a fat person a favor...stop
ga851103 -- sleeping.
ga851104 -- BONK! OUCH! - WHANG! YOU STUPID APPLE TREE! - Tink! I must learn to curb this temper of mine.
ga851105 -- My mom writes the greatest letters, Garfield. Listen to this... - - Don't spoil it for me, Jon. I'm waiting for the movie to come out.

ga851117 -- Hey, Garfield, did you ever wonder why they always have commercials at the good parts? - I wonder if fish have taste buds. - I hate it when Jon fishes. His mouth starts wandering. - Where do the ripples in the water go? - If people had fur
ga851117 -- all over their bodies, would they have to wear clothes? - Why do light bulbs burn out? - Am I boring you, Garfield?
ga851118 -- Hello, I'm RX-2, your talking scale. If you step on me, I'll tell you your weight. - GET OFF! GET OFF! GET OFF! GET OFF! - Whew! Thank you! Wise guy.
ga851119 -- How am I doing, RX-2? - You know those two pounds you lost last week? Yes. - They are back with reinforcements.
ga851120 -- - - You've gained weight, Garfield. I wonder how he knew me.
ga851121 -- How's my favorite talking scale? Are you ready to weigh me? - Uh...I'll tell you what. What? - What say we weigh one part at a time, and I'll give you a total. Very funny.
ga851122 -- - You weigh 175 pounds and you are 6 feet tall. - How do you know my height? I'm diversifying.
ga851123 -- Your weight is the same as yesterday, sir. Have a nice day. - Talking scales. What will they think of next? - What a lard ball. You're telling me?

ga851126 -- There's a nice thing about owning a cat. sniff - - CRASH! But I don't know what it is.
ga851127 -- Okay, talking scale, how much do I weigh? - Do you mind if I ask a personal question first? Shoot. - How many of you are there?
ga851128 -- Garfield, you eat food like it grows on trees. I wasn't born yesterday. I know the food fairy brings it in the night. - What if the food just stopped? I could handle that. - It's the eating I would miss.
ga851129 -- - - Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know this mailman was taken. That's quite all right.
ga851130 -- I know I haven't written yet, mom. I'm sorry. Yes, I'll come visit you when I can, okay? - I FEEL LIKE SUCH a HEEL! - Jon takes so many guilt trips, he qualifies for the frequent flyer plan.
ga851201 -- May I have your attention, please! - Ladieees and gentlemen! Odie-The-Amazing will now dive into this glass of water! - Of course he is going to need a little encouragement. - Go for it, Odie! I'm going to make you a star! - WHOAM! LET GO!

ga851208 -- disgusting. - It's no wonder we're still single, right, Garfield? Burp - BURP BURP Ignore them, Melissa. Men are not a pretty sight.
ga851209 -- Why the long face, Garfield? I don't know. - Are you depressed because you're fat and lazy and out of shape? - Why is it friends aren't happy until they've given some direction to your depression?
ga851210 -- You look a little depressed, Garfield. Bingo. - Just remember, when you're flat on your back, the only way to kook is up. Thank you, Jon. I am no longer depressed. - Now I'm suicidal.
ga851211 -- I have some words of wisdom to help you beat those old blues, buddy. - He's gonna get cryptic again. - Even a stopped clock is right twice a day. - Oh, great...I'm going to be up all night figuring that one out.
ga851212 -- I have you figured out, Garfield. You refuse to take life on because you're afraid of failure. - That shows what Jon knows about human nature. - Actually, I have a deep-seated fear of success.
ga851213 -- Garfield, your life is a big, fat drag. Do you know that? - You sleep to escape. You eat to escape... - You need more escapes.

ga851218 -- Hey, Garfield! Come on in! - - How do you do that? Simple...fat floats.
ga851219 -- You may not know this, Garfield, but I'm somewhat of an expert at reading tea leaves. - Ah, yes, it says here you will have a long and fruitful life. Your owner is kind and generous, and you will travel soon. - Any questions? May I have my
ga851219 -- cocoa back?
ga851220 -- Garfield, do you want your eggs beaten? Yeah. - And while you're at it, squeeze the orange juice. - Then choke some toast And mangle the bacon! I'm worried about that boy.

ga860619 -- Happy birthday, Garfield! We love you! - Do you know the best part of birthdays? - For a day, it's nice to have the world revolve around you!

ga860622 -- THAT'S IT! - - The mailman content of my blood was getting low.
ga860623 -- Will that be all? Irma, we haven't ordered yet. - Here's your check. Have a nice day. - Don't you care that we haven't eaten? Not as long as you leave a nice tip.
ga860624 -- What do you recommend, Irma? - The hamburger flambe, french fries flambe, chili soup flambe, and peach pie flambe. - What's with all the flambes? The kitchen is on fire.
ga860625 -- What'll you have, Jon? - I'll have whatever he's having. - Suit yourself.
ga860626 -- How's it going, Irma? Great! Just won the fast-food service division of the waitress awards. - What's the fast-food service award? - BLAT! BLAT!
ga860627 -- Here you go, fellas. The "Saturday Special". - This stuff tastes terrible! - Well, to be honest, it's the "Week-Ago-Saturday Special".
ga860628 -- Irma, I ordered a pie a la mode. Where's the scoop ice cream? It was there a minute ago. - WAH-HA! - I GOT IT! I'll hav ethe pie plain, thank you.
ga860629 -- You have a heart of stone, my dear. - Come on, guys. We have some shopping to do. Can't you see I'm meditating right now? - This lawn ornament is perfect for mom. How long have you hated your mother? - I think I'll grab a little nap while Jon
ga860629 -- shops. - Oh, Freeman! Look at that plaster cat! Z - Yawn! What a nice nap? - - Why is it all the rotten luck happens to me? Whine! - Oh, what are you complaining about?

ga860701 -- Okay, Odie, today we scare the mailman...look vicious! - - All right, let's practice slobbering on his shoes.
ga860702 -- Here comes the mailman. Now's my chance to shred his pant legs. - YOW! - Sorry, pal. I didn't notice you were wearing bermuda shorts.
ga860703 -- I hate it when I lose Garfield in the department store. - GARFIELD! WHERE ARE YOU? Over here. - House Plants By the...burp...salad bar.
ga860704 -- Normally I'd destroy Odie for this, but, luckily for him, I've had a change of heart. - PUNT! - Of course, it eill take a while for word to reach my foot.
ga860705 -- Good morning, Odie. - - How can you communicate with a dog whose brain didn't leave a forwarding address?
ga860706 -- Hold still, Odie. We'll get it open this time. - - Here's some change, Garfield. Get us some pop. - - CHUKONG! - I wonder what would happen if I put all the money in at once. CLINK CLINK - - CAJUNG!
ga860707 -- What a night! I dreamed the house was surrounded by a pack of vicious dogs chanting, "Send out the cat! Send out the cat!" - Good morning, Garfield. Would you like to go out? - I THOUGHT YOU WERE ON MY SIDE! Or would you rather stay in?
ga860708 -- OH, NO! JON'! FOAMING AT THE MOUTH! - QUICK! LET'S MAKE A BREAK FOR IT! - Good morning, boys. TOO LATE! LET'S SPLIT UP AND HOPE HE GOES AFTER YOU!
ga860709 -- That, son, is a cat. - He's a fat one and ugly, as cats go. - I may have to break our treaty agreement. Notice the sloping, criminal forehead.
ga860710 -- I can't understand it, Garfield, Why don't I have better luck with women? - Excuse me, Do you have the time? Only the rest of my life, you radiant thing you! - Perhaps you're a bit too eager.
ga860711 -- RRRRR - CLICK - Playing with the hair dryer, Garfield? I'm going for the natural look.
ga860712 -- Garfield, if you keep eating like that, you're going to explode. - POW! - Okay! Who shook the soda pop?
ga860713 -- Never tell a hungry cat the dinner is ALMOST ready. - Something smells good. What is it? - I'm going to bake a lasagna, Garfield, Do you wanna help? Let me think about it for a min...sure! - First we'll brown the hamburger with the tomato
ga860713 -- sauce and seasonings. I'd better see if this's fresh. - Then we'll scoop the ricota, slice the mozzarella and grate the parmesan. I'd better see if this stuff's NOT fresh. - Next, we'll lay a bed of noodles in the pan. One for me, one for the
ga860713 -- lasagna, one for me... - And no we'll bake it for one hour at 3750. - TIME PASSES - Gee, that recipe didn't make much lasagna. It apparently didn't take sampling into account.
ga860714 -- THERE'S NO ESCAPING IT! - IT'S GONNA GEt ME! - AHCHOO!
ga860715 -- Sniff. I'm allergic to something around here. I wonder if it's dogs? - SNIFF! - Nope.

ga860718 -- I'M GONNA SNEEZE! AH-AHH AHHH! - fft - Thank you. Where are you going? I'm going to boil my finger now.
ga860719 -- This is what's been making me sneeze! It's Jon's cologne. - It's called "Ditchdigger, The Working Man's Cologne". - And, as you know, I'm allergic to work.
ga860720 -- All right, who brought in the fleas. scritch scritch scritch - Sigh. - I'm bored. There's gotta be something to do. - Pets always seem to be able to entertein themselves. Maybe I could do what they do. - So...played with any good yarn lately?

ga860723 -- Monday 23 You're right, Garfield. Every day this week is monday. - I'm sure it's just a misprint. It doesn't mean anything. - Then again. GONK!
ga860724 -- I'd better check to see if it's still monday out there. - - SPLUT! Yup.
ga860725 -- Imagine having to suffer an entire week of mondays. Well, they're not getting me! - I'm spending the rest of the week in bed. - You gotta get up pretty early to put one over on old Garfield.
ga860726 -- - It must be wonderful to be that stupid. - For Odie, every day is saturday.
ga860727 -- HERE, KITTY, KITTY. - Uh-oh. - Hello, kitty. Would you like to come to my house? Take a hike, kid. - I'll fix you lots of good things to eat. I'm with you! - We'll have such a splendid time! - And you can play with Muffin, too. - Here you go,

ga860730 -- Don't eat this pie, Garfield. I won't. - You won't forget will you? I won't forget. I never forget. - I just have convenient lapses of memory.
ga860731 -- Sorry, boys. I just ran out of coffee. WHAT?! - Wait! You're in luck. I just remembered... - The last guy in here spilled his. I think I'm going to be sick.
ga860801 -- This is great. What did mom used to say about sleeping in laundry baskets? - - Ah, yes..."My son, sleep only in the clean laundry".
ga860802 -- This mirror should shame Garfield into losing some weight. - - Why, thank you for the charming and witty dinner companion, Jon. You can't shame a shameless cat.
ga860803 -- FROM DEEP WITHIN GARFIELD'S WORST FEARS IT...*CAME*! - SEE! THE MONDA yTHAT WOULDN'T DIE! Z - See! The attack of the incredible Slobber Monster! - See! The interminable visit of the cutest kitten on earth! ARRRGH! - See! The can opener that

ga860806 -- I'm going golfing, Garfield. Would you be my caddy? No way! I'm nobody's slave. - That's okay. I have somebody else in mind anyway. - Hello, caddy. - We're all doomed!
ga860807 -- Take my clubs, caddy! - Oops. HAR! HAR! WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NOW? - This is surely breaking some pet labor law.
ga860808 -- Fetch the ball, caddy. - ODIE! - Let's talk. Here comes the gounds keeper, and, yes, I believe he's carrying a gun.

ga860819 -- Oh, no! Mice have gotten into the cereal. - That settles it! It's time to take action! - WE GOTTA GET A CAT!
ga860820 -- GARFIELD! THERE'S A RAT IN THE CELLAR! So? - So I want you to catch him. - Then what am I supposed to do? Make a citizen's arrest? You're hopeless. You know that don't you?
ga860821 -- What are we going to do about the rat in the cellar? I KNOW! - - What are you doing? We'll poison him.
ga860822 -- Why do *I* have to catch the rat? They're mean, with large pointy teeth. - Hold on, boy. Remember you're a cat. A fierce, carnivorous, predarory animal. - THe KING OF THE JUNGLE! Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
ga860823 -- Did you get the rat, Garfield? You know, Jon, people should talk more. - The rat...did you catch the rat? All things can be worked out if you just use reason. - What happened? I gave him territory.
ga860824 -- Oh, great. - I hate spiders. - WHAP! Aack! - cough cough wheeze - daddy! speak to me! your father is dead, son. I'm a widow now. - I guess I should feel like a heel. - But, I don't. WHAP! Aack! Aack!
ga860825 -- Go get the paper, Garfield. Work! Work! Work! That's all I do around here. - I wonder what would happen if I just kept right on walking? - I guess I'm going to find out.
ga860826 -- Odie, it's been 10 minutes since I sent Garfield after the paper. Go find him. - - Why do I feel like I just sent the lamb after the lion?
ga860827 -- Gee, I sure miss the boys. - WHAT'S THAT?! - Oh yeah...that's quiet.
ga860828 -- GARFIELD! ODIE?! WHERE ARE YOU? - HA-HA, GUYS. THE JOKE'S OVER. NOE COME BACK HERE! - HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! Call the wagon, Reba! that's not a natural laugh!

ga861010 -- Gimme that! - I have plans for this radio controlled tank. - We'll take no prisoners.
ga861011 -- How cute, a toy tank. - BLAM! - Sorry about that. But, we had reason to believe your tuna casserole was leaking troop movement information to the enemy.
ga861012 -- I'm going to get Garfield to jog with me today by attacking his pride. - Hey, Garfield, I was going to challenge you to a race, but I decided not to humiliate you. You're too fat and out of shape to outrun a garden slug. - OH YEAH?! YOU'RE
ga861012 -- ON! My psychology is working! - GET ON YOUR MARK! GET SET! - G=! SLAM! - CLICK - There is never a need to outrun anything you can outwit.

ga861015 -- STOMP! - PUSH - POOMP!
ga861016 -- Garfield! You're not going to believe this! I was in a bakery today buying a cake when three midgets in gorilla costumes raced in, se tthe place on fire and ran out with the cash register! Wow! - Come on, Jon, Don't spare the details! -
ga861016 -- Chocolate or vanilla frosting?
ga861017 -- Today I will demonstrate "deep-knee-kricks". - This is one I'm sure just about all of you can do. - KRICK KRICK
ga861018 -- sigh - Anybody can exercise... - But this kind of lethargy takes REAL discipline.
ga861019 -- - SLUUUCK - - - - SPLOOSH! - I assume there's a reason for this. I'd like to get your assessment of the possibility of blueberry pancakes for breakfast.
ga861020 -- I'm ready this time. - Come on, monday, do your worst. - Garfield, we're going to see the vet today. Arrrghh!
ga861021 -- Tell me something, doc. - Why is it every time I bring a hoseplant home, Garfield eats it? - Given the shape he's in, it's one of the few things in his diet that can't outrun him. She's a funny lady.
ga861022 -- Give me one good reason why you won't go out with me, doc. - You're obnoxious, pushy, wishy-washy, slow-witted and boring. - Oh yeah? Well give me a second reason.
ga861023 -- Just what would I have to do to get you to go out with me, doc? - Stand on your head and scream like a chicken, for starters. - BUCK-BUCK-BUC-KAW! Dignity is not in this man's vocabulary.
ga861024 -- Look, Jon. My boyfriend wouldn't like it if he knew you were trying to ask me out. Oh, yeah? What's his name. - Nick "The Mangler" Scarlotti. Oooo! I'm impressed! - I AM impressed.
ga861025 -- How old is your cat, Mr. Arbuckle? - He's eight. Really? He doesn't look that old. - He shouldn't. He's only been awake for about two of those years. Is it any wonder I hate him?
ga861026 -- Oh oh! Jon has that "we're going to the vet" look. - I'm glad I don't have to get a dog shot. - I only have to get a little kitty shot, but you have to get a dog shot. - The dog shot needles are this long and real thick. - NEXT! - Okay, let's
ga861026 -- do the dog shot first. - There, that wasn't bad, was it? - Now for the kitty shot. Inside, I'm screaming.
ga861027 -- Sigh. - I don't think I could bear to see Odie pushed off the table today. - Therefore... push
ga861028 -- And now a word from our sponsor. - We guarantee in writing that, if you buy our products, we will make mor emoney than you do. - Refreshingly direct.
ga861029 -- Let's see...we have everything for the beach except a beach ball. - HEY, GARFIELD! BRING SOMETHING WE CAN KICK AROUND IN THE SURF! - Without even looking around, I know I should have rephrased that.
ga861030 -- Make yourself useful, Garfield. Here's an air mattress and an instruction sheet. - Unroll and lay flat. I can handle that. -
ga861031 -- - Remember, Garfield, there is no greater failing than apathy. - So what?
ga861101 -- Garfield, you're a pearl. Why, thank you, Jon. - And do you know how pearls are formed in oysters? Howzat? - THROUGH CONSTANT IRRITATION! Jon must not be happy with me.
ga861102 -- No fern is too tough for the Caped Avenger (urp!) - Steady, boy. Steady. - Okay, Odie. Let's ee if you're worthy of being the Caped Avenger's high performance mode of transportation! - FASTER! - FASTER! - ZIP! STOP! - Seat belt...the Caped

ga861104 -- - And what are YOU supposed to be? - Anothe rhapless bather falls prey to the tiger shark.
ga861105 -- The cunning tiger shark, the world's most efficient eating machine with the world's most vocarious appetite, spies a helpless feast! - FEEDINF FRENZY! - ptoo! Yuck! Anchovies!
ga861106 -- I suppose you think you look like a shark. You got it, buster. - Well you don't look anything like a shark! Oh, yeah? - Well just wait until my fin comes back from the cleaners!
ga861107 -- - CHOMP MUNCH GULP - Just when you thought it was safe to have breakfast...
ga861108 -- As the shark approaches his prey, he senses something amiss. - Oh, yeah, water! Sharks need water! -
ga861109 -- Happy people must know something we don't. - What's this? - Why, thank you, Garfield. - DOG FOOD! QUICK! GIMME SOMETHING TO DRINK! - HOT SAUCE! I'M BURNING UP! - GLUG GLUG GLUG - GOLDFISH WATER! ANTIDOTE! ANTIDOTE! - AARRGH! ANCHOVIES!! This
ga861109 -- could go on for days.
ga861110 -- Self-indulgence. - There's a message in those great words. - If you don't indulge yourself...nobody will.
ga861111 -- - POOMP! - Business lunch.

ga861113 -- Bus Stop Here it comes. - It's slowing down! Jon, you're so insecure. - Look at that, Garfield! A whole bus stopped just for me! You're a heavyweight, all right.
ga861114 -- - ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT! I'LL GET YOUR BREAKFAST! - sob sob Cracked like an egg.

ga861125 -- I have a special surprise for you today, Garfield! - Generic cat food. - Then feed it to a generic cat! toing SPLAT!
ga861126 -- You know, Garfield, you should really be thankful for the food you eat. - I am, Jon. I am. - I'm also thankful for the food you eat.
ga861127 -- Isn't life great, Garfield? We should count our blessings. - ZIP! - Whew! They're all there!
ga861128 -- Garfield, did you eat my jelly fille ddoughnut? - It was like this, Jon. It happened to be a rogue doughnut wounded in a jungle bakery. - Crazed with fear and pain, it charged my mouth and I was forced to eat it in self-defense. It's times
ga861128 -- like this I wish I understood him.
ga861129 -- I'M HOME! - Hi, Garfield. You're so nice to come home to!
ga861130 -- NUTS! STUCK AGAIN! - HEY, GARFIELD, DINNER! - SCREEE - GULP - Garfield, you can't still be hungry. - You have to lose weight. No mor efood until breakfast. - Do you really want that, Jon? Do you know what happens to skinny people? - THEY

ga861204 -- - Some people lose weight. - I just give it a temporary leave of absence.
ga861205 -- - Odie isn't exactly the brightest dog around. - His I-Q- is so low, you can't test it. You have to dig for it.

ga861210 -- Well, Garfield, what do you think of my party outfit? I like it. - It makes a statement. - And that statement is, "I'm a nerd".
ga861211 -- You're going to look great for the party. - Hey, Garfield, what do you think of Odie's costume? - It's just screaming for accessories.
ga861212 -- It's 9:30 and nobody's shown up for my party. What do we do now? - - Okay, food, my tongue's leaving town in 15 minutes. Be on it!
ga861213 -- I can't understand why no one came to my perty. Surely they got the invitations. - I told Odie to take them to the mailbox 3 days ago. - But did you tell him to put tehm IN the mailbox?
ga861214 -- Garfield, don't eat this food. It's for my party. - - Okay, Odie. Take these party invitations and put them in the mailbox. - - - Come on, Garfield. The social event of the season has arrived. DING DONG - I was expecting the upper crust. And
ga861214 -- you got the crumbs.

ga861218 -- - SQUEEZE - ARRRGH!
ga861219 -- Good news, Garfield. - I completely restuffed Pooky for you. -
ga861220 -- You know, with Pooky overstuffed like that, you two make a good match. - Like father, like son, eh? -
ga861221 -- Sign here, mister. - Hey, Garfield. I got an aluminium tree this year. No more mess. No more tradition. - And for splash and dash, it turns in an electric stand! Is nothing sacred? - If it's splash and dash Jon wants, this blender would make
ga861221 -- a keen tree stand. - Ready for me to plug the tree in, Garfield? Give me a head start! - WHIRRRR ARRRRGH! HEY, JON! WANT MORE DASH? TRY LIQUEFY!
ga861222 -- Get out of my way, Odie. I'm trying to wrap presents. - -
ga861223 -- Good evening, folks. I'd like to start by signing a few Christmas carols! - SPLUT! BLAT! SPLAT! - Critics don't even take the holidays off.
ga861224 -- Well, the gifts are under the tree and the food is prepared. There's only one more order of business... - I just want to tell you guys how much I love you. - Jon is like Christmas. I only appreciate him once a year.
ga861225 -- WAKE UP, BOYS! IT'S CHRISTMAS MORNING! - Let's see if Santa brought gifts for all the good little children. - I guess not. Here's one for Garfield. What the heck, it's Christmas. I'll let him live.
ga861226 -- The day after Christmas I always get drepressed. - Do you know what I mean, Garfield? Yes, I do. - If I were you I'd be depressed every day.
ga861227 -- What a dippy sweater. - It's not the gift, but thought that counts. - Okay, okay, I THINK it's a dippy sweater.
ga861228 -- EEK! - Here he is! Z - Excuse us, Mr. Cat. We desire cheese. - We can't sleep without our cheese. - And if we can't sleep, you won't sleep. - All right! All right! - Here, if there's nothing else, I'd like to get some sleep. - You wouldn't
ga861228 -- happen to have tiny little forks would you? Here's where I turn vicious.
ga861229 -- CAT HAIRS! They're a face of life. - THERE ARE CAT HAIRS ALL OVER THE PLACE! So, what are you going to do about it? - I'll be packing my bags and leaving now.
ga861230 -- Wherever I stop, we're stuck with it. Right, Garfield? Right. - The things Jon will do for excitement... - click click click click Television roulette.

ga870101 -- It's time to clean the fridge, Garfield. I'll call a S.W.A.T. team. - Grim. - I haven't seen these olives in years. And it's only halfway back.

ga870105 -- Attention, lounge lizards! This is your week in the sun. Today we begin celebrating "National Lazy Week"! - What's so great about being lazy, you say? - What if war were declared and nobody showed?
ga870106 -- Is National Lazy Week for you? Ask yourself this: - Would you be willing to lead a parade in celebration of the lazy life? - If the answer is yes...you're all wrong for Lazy Week.
ga870107 -- Never confuse being lazy with being apathetic. We lazy people are not apathetic. - Apathetic people don't care about anything. - Lazy people care, we just don't do anything about it.
ga870108 -- Do people call you "worthless"? Do people call you a "couch potato"? - Why should we be held up to public ridicule just because we subscribe to a kinetically passive lifestyle. We should stand up for ourselves! - THE NEXT TIME PEOPLE CALL YOU
ga870108 -- LAZY, TELL 'EM YOU WERE SICK WHEN YOU WERE A KID!
ga870109 -- Don't forget the National Lazy Week motto, lazy people. "There must be an easier way". - Many great ideas have been spawned from that noble sentiment. - You can bet it wasn't an exercise freak who invented power steering.
ga870110 -- For those of you who want to stop abusing your bodies through fanatic exercise, but can't muster the willpower... - You can now join "Garfield's Exercisers Anonymous". - Every time you feel an uncontrollable urge to jog, I send someone over
ga870110 -- with a mug of warm milk and a tape of the Beverly Hillbillies.
ga870111 -- Waterin' down the coffee again, pilgrim? - Burp - - JON! - JON! WAKE UP! I'M HAVING NIGHTMARES! - Garfield, if you didn't stuff yourself right before going to bed, you wouldn't dream about big, ugly monsters. - Did you hear what he called you
ga870111 -- guys? - I think I'll polish off that pepperoni pizza now.
ga870112 -- Isn't this great, Garfield? We have a whole day of fishing ahead of us! Hotcha. - HEY! WHERE's THE BAIT? Bait? - GARFIELD! I thought it was sushi.
ga870113 -- Actually, Garfield is pretty easy to care for. - Cats are so clean, always primping and washing themselves. - We're out of foot powder. Almost to a fault.
ga870114 -- Ah, my dear, you're as lovely as ever, but, you look so stiff and formal in that outfit. - Why don't you slip into something more comfortable? - LIKE ME!
ga870115 -- - CHOMP! - SPRONG!
ga870116 -- Just what is an heirloom? - A heirloom is something that's been in your family for generations... - That no one's had the guts to pitch out.
ga870117 -- zzzzzzz - zzzzzzz - zzzzzz Just as I suspected.
ga870118 -- * Oh, Nermalll * - Kittens love to chase things. - CRASH! This can be a very satisfying form of enterteinmant. - BONK! Kittens also love to play catch. - But, the best way to drive them wild is to hide objects from them. - ROWR! cRUNCH! HISS!
ga870118 -- - But, not for very long.
ga870119 -- GARFIELD! WAKE UP! - I've made a decision that could alter the course of my entire life. - I have decided to grow a mustache. I suppose I could blame this on monday.
ga870120 -- Notice anything different about me, Garfield? You're not drinking out of your Binky The Clown mug. - I think my mustache is coming in rather nicely. That's not your cocoa? - Wanna touch it? It feels really weird. Hey, buddy, I have to eat
ga870120 -- with these hands!
ga870121 -- Look Odie! A hideous hairy monster is nesting under Jon's nose! - Maybe it'sll spread and cover the rest of his face. - Are you making fun of me? IT MOVED!
ga870122 -- Mustaches do strange things to people. - They make some guys think they're someone they're not. - Frankly, my dear, I don't give a darn. I don't feel safe here anymore.
ga870123 -- ARRRGH! - JON! WHAt HAPPENED? I'M FINE! GO AWAY! - ARE YOU OKAY? TELL ME! The shaver snagged my mustache, okay?
ga870124 -- I shaved my mustache off, Garfield. Do tell. - I decided it made me look like a walrus. I'm proud of you, Jon. - It takes a big walrus to admit his mistakes.
ga870125 -- How's my little buddy today? Crowded. - TAP TAP TAP - Garfield, what are you doing? - SNAP! Charades? I love charades! Let's see...first word...you? No, you're! That's it! You're! - Leg! No! Stand! You're standing in something! - Fourth word!
ga870125 -- MY! You're standing in my! - I GOT IT! FOOD! YOU'RE STANDNIG IN MY FOOD! - That was a good one. Now it's my turn. This is a movie title, okay?
ga870126 -- - - Amused, Garfield? That's "Mr. Fig Face" to you.
ga870127 -- * - *
ga870128 -- Here I am falling asleep face down in a bowl of food. - This is it. I've reached the pinnacle of laziness and gluttony...how depressing. - There's no place to go after you've reached the top.
ga870129 -- I eat too much because I'm depressed, and I'm depressed because I eat too much. - It's a vicious circle... - That took years to perfect!
ga870130 -- BANG! BANG! Hello? Anybody home? - BRINNNNNG! - Next time, use the door knocker. Sorry.
ga870131 -- - STOP RIGHT THERE! - Sometimes that's all a cat understands.
ga870201 -- Don't slobber on the controls, Mr. Odie! - WHAT HO?! - Pistachios! And they're all mine! - crack BOING! - SNIFF SNIFF SNIFF - SNORT! - SLURP! - Dogs APPEAR friendly, but, I'd hate to get caught between one and his appetite. BURP
ga870202 -- - BONK! - GARFIELD! SPEAK TO ME! Aunty Em? Is that you?
ga870203 -- Garfield! That was a nasty fall you took. Are you all right - Garfield? Who's Garfield? - OH, nO! HE'S LOST HIS MEMORY! I do seem to rememger being hungry.
ga870204 -- Having anmesia isn't so bad. It'll be kind of fun finding out what a great guy I am. - ARRRGH! - OH, NO! I'M A CAT!
ga870205 -- Maybe seeing Odie will jog your memory. What a swell looking dog. Put 'er there. - YIP! YIP! YIP! - I woner if I'm going to like this Garfield?
ga870206 -- Look, Garfield. It's Pooky! Your favorite possession and closest friend. Do you remember Pooky? - Don't be silly. I'm a grown cat. What would I need with a teddy bear?
ga870207 -- Amnesia has wiped my slate clean. I start establishing who I am today. - - I am (burp) a glutton.
ga870208 -- Hey, stranger. This body ain't big enough for the both of us. - What a week...I fall on my head, totally lose my memory, and have no idea who this Garfield fella is. - - HANg ON! SOMETHING'S COMING BACK! - HA! HA! - WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! - I'm
ga870208 -- terribly sorry about that. You see, I'm not myself today.
ga870209 -- Amnesia is weird. This Garfield is like a total stranger to me. - I know nothing about him. - Aside from what the creep did to my body.
ga870210 -- This should jog your memory, Garfield... LASAGNA! - No thank you. You wouldn't have a plump, juicy mouse, wouldn't you? - ARRRGH! I'd never get this stuff out of my whiskers.
ga870211 -- You just HAVE to restore Garfield's memory, doc. - He doesn't beat up on Odie, he doesn't claw the furniture, he's not lazy and obnoxious... - Are you sure you want me to do this? Come to think of it...
ga870212 -- Let's test his reflexes. DONK! - - DOING! Normal. For Garfield.
ga870213 -- Perhaps Garfield's amnesia could be cured by lightly traumatizing his cranium. - KNOCK MY CAT ON THE HEAD?! WHO WOULD EVER DO SUCH A THING?!! - May I be of assistance? You stay out of this.
ga870214 -- Go ahead. A little tap on the head may bring your cat's memory back. DONK! - GONK! - HEY! I CAN REMEMBER! IT'S ME! GARFIELD THE CAT! Garfield? Who's Garfield?

ga870222 -- This kind of tired calls for coffee straight up. - - It's one of those mornings. - The kind of morning where you've been up for two minutes and it feels like two days. - If I can just make it to my coffee, I'll be all right. - It's in sight!
ga870222 -- Come on, Garfield! You can make it! - WHUMP! - Z So close, and yet so far.

ga870303 -- - ARRRGH! - It was only a dream! It was only a dream! It was only a dream!
ga870304 -- Garfield, I just don't know what I see in you. It is a bit overwhelming, isn't it? - You're rude, obnoxious, fat, selfish, egotistical, and totally devoid of any charm. - I AM NOT EGOTISTICAL
ga870305 -- Arlene, I think it's time we get serious. You do? - Yes, serious about getting that gap between your teeth fixed. - The truth hurts.
ga870306 -- YAWN - ARRRRGH! -
ga870307 -- I love it when Jon loves a cake. - 'cause I get to lick the icing out of the bowl. - GARFIELD!! Of course, he'd prefer I wait till AFTER he's iced the cake.
ga870308 -- * - FFT! BANG! UGH! Rats! The washer's broken! - Com on, Garfield, we have to go to the laundromat. - NO, JON! PLEASE ANYWHERE BUT THERE. - You know what that place is like! Especially on weekends. - I'll get him for this.
ga870309 -- Garfield, you need more vegetables in your system. What are you going to do? Drive a carrot through my heart? - Here, have some spinach. OH-NO! - GASP! CHOKE! COUGH! Stop being melodramatic, Garfield.
ga870310 -- Eat your spinach, Garfield. - It's good for you. - Well, now that's more like it!
ga870311 -- Have some spinach, Garfield. - Sure, and let's garnish it with a big box of raisins. - ZIP! I HATE THEM TOO!
ga870312 -- Spinach. - It tastes bad. It looks bad. - SPLUT! It even sounds bad.
ga870313 -- Yuck! Spinach! - - Garfield! You ate all your spinach! Not really. It's in the saltshaker.
ga870314 -- I hate spinach. - It's green, it's slimy. - And it looks like it's moving.
ga870315 -- SMACK! You used all the hot water again. - La la laaah - * - - - - SLAM! - Isn't that disgusting? Just look at that, Reba! I'm looking! I'm looking!
ga870316 -- RRINNGG! - Hello? Iuh, I think you have the wrong number. - But...would you care to make it the right number, songbird? This is a lonely man here.
ga870317 -- So what's your name, sweet thing? I can't believe Jon! - How about a date? Trying to get a date with a wring number. - Tomorrow at seven? Great! A DESPARATE wrong number.
ga870318 -- Garfield, I'd like you to meet my date. - MOMMA MIA! - What's with your cat? He's, uh, terrified of daisies.
ga870319 -- Now, be nice to my date. She might be sensitive about her weight. How'd she get in here? Through the garage door? - Her name is Bertha. Figures. - She's a lovely person. You can't judge a book by it's cover, you know. And you can't judge a
ga870319 -- ship by its hull.
ga870320 -- Bertha, I'd like you to meet Garfield. - He could use some meat on his bones. - Affectionate sort, isn't he? He's a sucker for sweet talk.
ga870321 -- Think, Jon, think. There's gotta be SOMETHING nice to say to your date. - My, your teeth are round. I eat a lot. - You don't say! No! Really!
ga870322 -- Yes, sir. Table for five. - Z - - There it is! Just like I told you! Z - Hey, cat! What is the meaning of this trap? Wha...? - You realize this is a direct violation of our treaty agreement. Aw, gimme a break. - You know this means war! Look,
ga870322 -- nobody says you have to step on it. TO ARMS! TO ARMS! This should be cute. - I remember when I liked mice.
ga870323 -- Now don't make a bad impression on my date. Don't worry, Jon. I'll leave that up to you. - Ready for dinner, Bertha? - Is the sky blue? Do cats hate dogs?
ga870324 -- I think you're going to like this restaurant, Bertha. As long as they serve food. A woman after my own heart. - Would you like a table or a booth? A table, please. And the lady will have a booth. - What do you have to do to get any serive
ga870324 -- around here? You have to get to your table first. That's a stupid rule.
ga870325 -- And how would madame like her steak? - Just run the steer by the table and I'll grab off a hunk! - HAW! HAW! HAW! HAW! HAW! HAW! Et tu, Garfield?
ga870326 -- Boy, I couldn't eat another bite. Would you like my... - SHOOP! - rrrr rrrr I guess we don't need a doggie bag.
ga870327 -- How was your meal, Bertha? GREAT! THANKS! SLAP! SPLUT! - Just be thankful she didn't hate it.
ga870328 -- It was nice meeting you, Bertha. I hope you had a good time. - OH, I had a wonderful time! mmmph! - How was your date? I think I made an impression on her.
ga870329 -- HA! HA! HA! HEE! HA! - - Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, naaaah * - * We're going for a walk, and you have to wear a dog coat. * - * We're gonna walk by some dogs, and they're gonna call you a nerd. * - * Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, naaaah * - Come on,
ga870329 -- Garfield, let's get ready for our walk. - Maybe lightning will strike me, and save me the humiliation.
ga870330 -- Garfield, meet the newest member of our family, Sweety Bird. - I just know you two are going to get along famously, right, Garfield? - Right, sure. Uh, would you happen to have a light for my cutting torch?
ga870331 -- Hello, I'm Sweety Bird. I sing sweet happy songs to brighten your morning. - BRIGHTEN MY MORNING?! DO YOU WANT TO BRIGHTEN MY MORNING?! - Then you can march out of that cage and crawl  between two slices of bread. JON!
ga870401 -- Garfield, do you like sweety bird? He's right up there with dogs and mondays. - You wouldn't intend him any harm, would you? I don't know what you're talking about. - Then why is he covered with clam sauce? An old family recipe.
ga870402 -- SQWAWK! - HONK! - Did we remember how to open the bird cage? Not only that, we forgot birds could fly.
ga870403 -- Hey, bird! You think you're safe out there, huh? - Well, I have a little treat for you! - Have you, perchance, ever heard a cat scream?
ga870404 -- Hey, Garfield! What are you doing out there? - And look! Sweety bird's on your head! - WHERE'S MY CAMERA? I loathe life.
ga870405 -- - - - - You know, Garfield, sharing is one of life's greates pleasures. - GULP! - I love giving people pleasure.
ga870406 -- Hurry, Garfield, the TV workout show is about to start! - You promised you''d try it. So let's go. Okay, but first answer me this... - Just how the heck am I supposed to move?
ga870407 -- GARFIELD! - YOU SHREDDED MY RUNNING SHOES! Someday you'll thank me for that, Jon. - Jogging's the disease. I'm the cure.
ga870408 -- Okay, stand up straight and put your hands on your hips. - Those of you too fat to find your hips, just give it your best guess. - I hate sarcastic fitness instructors.
ga870409 -- Now for jumping jacks on the two count. - ONE! CRASH! - Oh, by the way, before we get to two, don't try this exercise on a recently polished floor. NOW he tells me.
ga870410 -- That's good, everybody. Push up! - ...and down! - ...and up!... I was built for push-ups.
ga870411 -- No, seriously, Linda, I'm a fun guy. I do great impressions! - You do impressions too? Let's hear one. - Listen to this, Garfield, She sounds like a dial tone! This man has no brain.
ga870412 -- The lone gourmet strikes again. - TAP! TAP! - YAWN - You go out and play, Pooky. - ZIP! WHAT tHE...? - HEY, WAIT A MINUTE! I'M NAILED TO MY BED! - WHA?!! - I suppose this was for putting the lizard in your shoe? Now we're even.
ga870413 -- You're a slob, Garfield, Why can't you stay as clean as other cats? - You're supposed to wash yourself like this. Oh, very well. - Start with this arm and make it snappy. You have a lot of territory to cover.
ga870414 -- - - See anything you like?
ga870415 -- Do you know what I hate most about this bed? - UNNNGH! - Trying to sleep on my back.
ga870416 -- It's time to get up. - CREAK! CRACK! - It's also time to go on and diet.
ga870417 -- OH, NO! YOU CHEWED UP MY NEWSPAPER AGAIN! - Hey! This isn't the paper I get. It must belong to a neighbor. - KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! A 250 lb. neighbor, to be precise.

ga870419 -- I hate 3-D movies. - Here, Odie! Here, boy! - I'll throw the bone and you fetch it, okay, boy? Arf! - There it goes! - Odie just fell for the oldest trick in the book. - ZIP! WHUMP - Now what kind of dog would have a bone that big? - Oh, THAT

ga870728 -- Got my equipment, got my flies. Let's go fishing! - Hang on, Garfield! - My body is hooked to the drapes. - This is going to be a long day.
ga870729 -- Poor little worms, waiting to be skewered on Jon's hook and then fed to some vicious fish. Well it's not right! - YOU'RE FREE! YOU'RE FREE! - Swimming must not be one of their strong suits.

ga870815 -- Uh-oh, it looks as though Mr. Cliche is about to unburden himself of another stale platitude. - "He who fills his pockets with the rocks of misdeeds will surely sink in the river of good fortune". - That boy wasn't born, he was found in a
ga870815 -- fortune cookie.
ga870816 -- - Is this seat taken? Not at all. - Wow! That's a big cat! He didn't look that big from the front of the bus 'cause things look smaller from far away. - You, if he had a mane he'd look like a lion, but, then they'd make him get off at the
ga870816 -- zoo, I suppose! - Zoos make me nervous. I'm never sure which side of the bars I'm on. I wonder if the animals feel that way too? - Well, I gotta change seats. You guys talk too much. I can't hear myself think. - You sure meet some characters
ga870816 -- on the bus. Watch what you say! Uranus has spies everywhere!

ga870819 -- You've got a pretty good thing going here, don't you? Yup. - Jon feeds me, strokes me, changes my kitty litter and caters to my whims. So what does HE get out of it? - He gets to call himself "Master".
ga870820 -- With each new day, a cat's curiosity must be satisfied anew. - KICK - Yup, the law of gravity is still in effect.
ga870821 -- Dear Hair Ball Cat Food Co., I find your cat food gives my cat a "long silky coat of hair" as advertised... - However, I think you should add a disclaimer. - "Do not feed your cat more than 36 cans a day."
ga870822 -- You're wasting your life away, Garfield. You should be out there...uh... - Out there doing whatever it is cats do. - That's what I like about being a cat. Our standards are low.
ga870823 -- Up next, "Pasta Parade," followed by "World of Waffles". I love this all-food channel. - I ask you...what more to life could there possibly be? - Decisions, decisions... - Should I eat first and then sleep or sleep first and then eat? -
ga870823 -- Hmmm...I usually eat first. Maybe I should sleep first for a change of pace. - On the other hand, if I sleep first, Odie might eat my food before I wake up. - * - Z
ga870824 -- Stupid pet door! - UI thought Jon fixed it! - Unnngh!
ga870825 -- Jon, remember when you thought it was a great idea to put the pet door in? - And how Odir and I could come and go as we pleased? - You goofed again.

ga870827 -- PURRR - How nice! Are you rubbing against my neck to tell me how much you love me? - Or to tell me, if I don't feed you'll rip off my face? Bingo!

ga921129 -- Sigh - I don't like this beach, Garfield. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I hate my swimsuit. But, the knees were worn out of your old one. - The lifeguard kicked sand in my face. I'll have a word with her. - Those people told me to put my shirt on.
ga921129 -- Well, they were eating. - The I went swimming and got seaweed up my nose. It was pretty funny when the kids ran away screaming. - Let's go home. As soon as Odie finishes rolling on the dead fish.

ga921214 -- - - Christmas is coming.
ga921215 -- We're looking for a Christmas tree. How about an artificial one? - What's the difference? You don't have to water an artificial tree. - So? We don't water the real ones anyway.

ga930115 -- For the dieter, here's a fridge with a full-length mirroe. Absurd. - For the indecisive diner, this one features a peephole. Silly. - And for the cat owner...a pet door. Practical.
ga930116 -- Now this fridge has a 19" TV installed right in the door. - And for the hopelessly decadent... - A roll away bed! What? No hot tub?

ga010401 -- Sigh - We should do something. - How about mailing Mrs. Feeny's little dog to an obscure overseas nation with insufficient postage? - Or we could thumb wrestle for that last piece of cheesecake. - Or we could hijack an ice cream truck and
ga010401 -- hold the driver hostage for the world's largest nutty-buddy. - Or we could paint oursevles purple, sit in the bathtub too long, and pretend we're raisins. - Checkers? I'm red this time.

ga010423 -- What are you? I'm a rooster. - What do you do? I wake you up at the crack of dawn. - I didn't hear the rooster this morning. I imagine it's tough to crow with baling twine tied around one's beak.

ga010522 -- Don't you love springtime, Garfield? - The warmth...thle flowers. - Even you are smiling! I have a mouth full of butterflies.
ga010523 -- I pushed Odie off the roof! - Fortunately, his fall was broken when he landed on Jon. - Come closer, Garfield. Look, Odie! He crawled in here all by himself!
ga010524 -- Garfield, you sleep too much. I have a condition. - And there's a name for that. "Exerciseophobia". - Lazy! The fear of sweat.

ga010602 -- Ahhh...a filling meal at a greasy diner. Burrraap. - Then home to fall asleep on the couch in front of the TV! - Check! It just doesn't get any better than this.
ga010603 -- - Almost ready... - KACHING! CLONK My eye! - Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! - SPLORT! - WAAAAH SCHLIIIP!!!! - Here's your toast. I think I'll just have a cold bagel instead.

ga010605 -- I really should cut the grass...but it's such a nice day. - Maybe I'll water it instead. - What's with the sunglasses? You're blinding me with your logic.

ga040506 -- Garfield, I'm not sure you can be trusted. - Why would you say that? - Oh, look. I found your wallet.
ga040507 -- You're a bad boy, Garfield! I can't help it. - Sometimes couches just cry out to be clawed. - I'm never taking you to a furniture store again. You're no fun.
ga040508 -- It would be wrong to pull Odie's tail. - ...and then kick him off the table. - What are you doing? Making a list.

ga040512 -- We can't do anything about the past. - But we CAN dom something about the future. Sounds like a lot of effort to me. - I like the future just the way it's going to be.
ga040513 -- - - I am not boring! Tell that to the expression on my face.
ga040514 -- What's that smell? - I have no idea. - But it does seem to be emanating from the general area of my tuna can collection.
ga040515 -- I couldn't find my hat! - Then it occured to me that I didn't have one! - So I didn't wear it! Now I remember why I didn't want to get out of bed.

ga040530 -- Sigh... - Garfield, I'm depressed. What a absolute shock. - I haven't had a date in months. Time sure flies when you're not having fun. - Maybe I should give Kimmy a call. Wasn't she the one who was raised by wolves? - She was raised by

ga040602 -- Sigh... - I have nothing to celebrate. - For the 100th day in a row!
ga040603 -- This day needs improving. - I have to admit, that's not bad.
ga040604 -- Who knows...maybe someday I'll visit another planet. - Give it up, Jon. - You won't be able to get a date there either.

ga080516 -- Don't you hate being an alley cat, Arlene? - ...don't you have to live with a *dog*? - Sure is a quiet night.
ga080517 -- All you think about is yourself, Garfield. - That's not true! - Sometimes *I* think about *you* thinking about *me*. sigh
ga080518 -- - - step step step step step - unscrew unscrew unscrew unscrew - screw screw screw sc...ZZZT . THUD tinkle * tinkle * tinkle * - Don't even smile. Inside I'm rolling on the floor in hysterical laughter.
ga080519 -- Mini Golf -> I've never been miniature golfing before. I must warn you, I'm a pro at it. - "Jonny Ace" they call me...I even have my own putter! - Of cour'se, it's been a while... Back when he was but a wee little nerdlet.
ga080520 -- Now, in miniature golf, you just swing easy...noe, don't be nervous...easy... - PLUNK - It went in the hole. Is that good? Uh-huh It's only a game. It's only a game.
ga080521 -- TAP BOBK - - You'll have to play that one from the parking lot. STUPID GIANT BUNNY RABBIT!!

ga080523 -- So how did I do on the front nine? We're still adding up your score. - - My cell phone has a calculator. NEVER MIND!!
ga080524 -- So what? So your girlfriend beat you at miniature golf...so she better cooks than you...so she's smarter than you... - - *You* are pathetic.
ga080525 -- Boop Bip Beep Beep Bip - Hi, Jon, it's Liz. I can't decide what to wear tonight. - At first I thought my blue dress would be perfect, but then I decided my red top and skirt would look even better... - Then I couldn't find any shoes to go
ga080525 -- with *that*, so I switched to the green cocktail dress, but the zipper on that was stuck... - So I tried the purple strapless gown on, but the clutch purse that goes with it has a huge mascara smudge on it, and besides, I still think it makes
ga080525 -- my hips look big... - So now I'm back to the dress, unless I can find a way to make that red top and skirt work with sandals, or something open-toed in a neutral color. - What are you wearing? My suit. Hurray for guys.
ga080526 -- Hey, what are you looking at, fuzzball? Lunch, if you don't can the attitude. - Ha! I eat cats like you for breakfast! Oh, yeah? - ? Prove it!
ga080527 -- Nermal, have you ever had cosmetic surgery? Can you keep a secret? - Yes. See this eyelash? - Yessss?... *That's* real.
ga080528 -- Garfield, have *you* ever thought about cosmetic surgery? What, improve on *this*? - - That has to be the best straight line you've ever given me. It was a accident, okay?
ga080529 -- You're not so cute. - - Eww, yes you are. Why, thank you.
ga080530 -- You think *you're* the only one who can look cute? - Check *this* out! - You call *that* cute? Wait, wait. I'm a little out of practice.
ga080531 -- Don't hate me because I'm cute. - -I' m getting tired of replacing that door. Try spackle.
ga080601 -- BAM! BAM! - BAM! BAM! Garfield! - BAM! BAM! BAM! Garfield, open the door! - Garfield!! My arms are full of groceries! - - Well! It's about... - ...time. Oooh, cookies!

ga080604 -- Dogs... - - THUD They aren't real good at sharp turns.
ga080605 -- - - That's a lot of sausages. That's so I can find my way back to the butcher shop.
ga080606 -- Hey, Garfield! Come and see! - - Not particularly moved by sunrises, are we?
ga080607 -- I would like to dedicate this next number to my idol. - BLAAAATTPP - Obviously, my idol does not play the trumpet.
ga080608 -- - You're really attached to Garfield, aren't you? - We've been together a long time. - Just like an old married couple. - - A looooonnnnng time. SLAP! And what's *that* supposed to mean?! - I think I'll check the roast. I want a divorce! I

ga080610 -- Don't let this birthday thing get you down, Garfield. - Hey, your age is only a number...right? - A big honking number. The ears still work, by the way.
ga080611 -- Hey, geezer. - I hear your birthday cake is coming with a smoke alarm! - That spider looks like it's laughing. Get me a ladder and a bat.
ga080612 -- Another birthday...maybe it's time to start thinking about my future. - Time to start making some plans... - Time to put that new hip on layway. So *that's* why cats eat mice.
ga080613 -- clack clack clack clack clack clack - clack clack clack clack clack - I am NOT OLD!
ga080614 -- Have you thought about what kind of birthday cake you want? - - Besides "large"? There's another kind?

ga080616 -- Only three more days... - And you'll be a year older. - Sez you!

ga080618 -- Tomorrow is my brthday... - This year I shall celebrate in an age-appropriate manner. Cool! - I *love* musical wheelchairs!
ga080619 -- In the minus column, there's loss of memory, loss of hair, acquisition of nose and ear hair, liver spots, wrinkles, achy joints, and saggy skin. - In the plus column: cake. - No contest. HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
ga080620 -- Hi, Liz! Hello, Jon. - Wow! What smells so good? My perfume? - Mmmmm...beef... Ah, that would be my *other* perfume.

ga080623 -- Jon's washing his car. - All done! -
ga080624 -- Well, *that* was aggravating. - I got one of those shopping carts with a weird wheel. - I had to shop in circles for an hour. I hope it was in the donut aisle.
ga080625 -- - How was the meat loaf? Great! - BLEAH!
ga080626 -- Wow. - - There sure is a lot of napping going on.
ga080627 -- Wanna bat me around? Nah...I don't feel like it. - A little Macrame then, perhaps? Okay, now you're *really* reaching.
ga080628 -- Supergarfield stands for truth... - Justice... - And shedding!
ga080629 -- - Arlene's coming this way! - She'll try to flirt with me, like she always does. - It's pathetic, really... - Act like you don't even notice her, Garfield. - Poor, needy thing.
ga080630 -- Isn't this great, Garfield? Wonderful. - Here we are, back on the farm! Yee-ha. - I'm gonna go hug a cow! Long time, no date.
ga080701 -- Who are you? I'm a barn cat. - I'm Garfield. I'm Barney. - Where do you live? Okay, Flash, let's start again...
ga080702 -- What are you? I'm a chicken. - Riiiight... - If you're a chicken, where's the breading?
ga080703 -- Kids, farms are where we get our food. - Cereal, fruit, vegetables... - Excuse me, sir. Where might I find the whipped cream trees?
ga080704 -- Looks like rain. Yup. - Yup. Yup. - Yup, yup. Yup, yup, yup. And they say the art of conversation is dead.
ga080705 -- One of the best things about the farm is all the *nature*... - It's *everywhere*! - Like under your shoe.
ga080706 -- - Jon, you need to rethink your wardrobe. I do? - Come on, we'll start by going through your closet. - Hmmm...let's see...well, this has to go...oh, ick, and this, too... But I love that shirt! - And this, and this, and this, and this, and
ga080706 -- WHAT is THAT?! THAT? - YEEEEEEEEEK!!! Poor thing. - She found the powder blue polyester leisure suit. It still fits!
ga080707 -- We've been together a long time, Garfield. Long time. - Remember the good old days? That's not what I'd call them. - Remember when I got the brussels sprout stuck in my navel? Those were the STUPID old days.
ga080708 -- Hey, Garfield, you know that checkout lane at the grocery store for 10 items or less? - Well, Sir, I made it through with 12, count em', *12* items! - One small step for man, one giant leap for nerdkind.
ga080709 -- I like to think I'm unique. - - Believe me, Jon, we *all* like to think you're unique.
ga080710 -- Through the dragon's nose, over the moat under the castle, and into the hole! - WHACK! -Over the dragon, under the lights, through the snack bar, and into a fat lady's chilli dog. FORE!
ga080711 -- Let's see, that's another hole in one for me... - And another hole in one for you, too, Garfield. - And where's Jon? He's still cursing out the plaster pirate on thirteen.
ga080712 -- Jon suspects nothing. - - Darn guard sock puppet.
ga080713 -- - - - - - -
ga080714 -- I don't think I'm getting enough rest. - Not to worry! - I'll pick up the slack.
ga080715 -- I don't suppose you'll be moving today? - I don't suppose you'd care to get some exercise? - I don't suppose you'd care to go outside?! I don't suppose you see any wheels on this bed?
ga080716 -- Two days, and you haven't so much as moved an Eyelid! - That must take some willpower. Au contraire. - MOVING required willpower.
ga080717 -- Day three, and you still haven't moved. Aren't you afraid of losing muscle tone? - - Sorry, stupid question. I'll say.
ga080718 -- I had trouble sleeping. - - I tossed and turned all afternoon.
ga080719 -- Z - Wake up! - Didn't I do that yesterday?
ga080720 -- - And now we have a dedication... - This one goes out to Liz... - ...from her boyfriend Joh, with all the love in his heart. - So here it is, Liz, just for you...a little something called... - "You're the rooty-tooty cross-eyed cutie who put
ga080720 -- the oom in my oom-pa-pa." - RING That would be Liz telling me how much she loves the song! Especially the Kazoo solo.
ga080721 -- All is well in my world. - STOMP! STOMP! STOMP! - Except for the whole cats-wearing-boots thing.
ga080722 -- - -
ga080723 -- I don't believe it! - Liz is out with another guy!... But why?! - I bet if I disguised myself as a french waiter I could find out what was going on over there. - But that would be incredibly stupid, wouldn't it? Absolutely. - - - I'm going
ga080723 -- in. My hero!
ga080724 -- You're at the top of my hate list, FATSO! - SMACK - Right up there with magazines!
ga080725 -- Okay, men! - HEAVE...HO!!! - This does not bode well... Bring in the giant cactus plant!
ga080726 -- - SMACK! - For this, I went to college?
ga080727 -- - I hope you're not planning a fancy surprise party for my birthday. - Fancy? - tap tap - FWEEEEEEP - NOTHING'S too fancy for our Jon.
ga080728 -- Z - Awwww. Z - He remembered my birthday. Z
ga080729 -- Liz took me out to a nice restaurant for my birthday. - A *really* nice restaurant. - ...*glass* catsup bottles! Fancy-schmancy.
ga080730 -- There's nothing like a fresh vegetable. - And let's keep it that way! -
ga080731 -- Who's that? That's my neighbor, Mrs. Feeny. - - Why is she digging a moat around her house? I have my suspicions...
ga080801 -- Liz paid for our date last night. - That made me feel a little weird. - It was a *good* weird, though. Free weird is a good weird.
ga080802 -- Jon and I make a nice couple, don't you think, Garfield? - Yes. Sort of like the way Argyle socks and polka-dotted bow ties go toghether. - I sense sarcasm in that smile. You're getting to know me.
ga080803 -- Hey! - I've got *news* for you, buddy... - You're not so smart! - You're...not...so...smart! poke poke poke - What do you think of *that*? - - ZIP

ga080806 -- Look, flowers! Liz sent *me* flowers! - - Is that even legel? Better draw the blinds.
ga080807 -- Thanks for the flowers, Liz! You're welcome, Jon. - They were great. - "Were"? Were. BURP
ga080808 -- Okay, who had the coffees? - Um... Just a little coffee-bar humor, Sir. - That guy always looks so sad. Your tips could make Binky the Clown sad.
ga080809 -- I'm back from the store! - sklish sklish sklish sklish sklish sklish - The sprayers in the produce aisle got me again. In the right light, you do resemble a giant brussels sprout.
ga080810 -- boop - Hello?...Liz?!---Sorry. I must have pushed your speed-dial number by mistake! - I was calling to order a pizza...say, would you like to join us?...Great! - Sure, pick up a movie on the way over! We'll make a night of it! - Wow, I

ga080820 -- Ahem. - I am not too fat! - And I am not sensitive about my weight!
ga080821 -- I'm fat. - You're fat. - AM NOT!
ga080822 -- I am not. - You're fat. - We've had that conversation before.

ga080825 -- - CRACK! - You must diet now. Be a pal and slide some food down here.
ga080826 -- You should eat a little less at each meal. - I could do that, I suppose. - Of course, it would mean doubling up on the snacks!
ga080827 -- Did you ever stop to think that you might eat so much because of some emotionel need? - ...that you eat to compensate for some inner need? Of course. - It's called hunger, you dipstick.
ga080828 -- I know it's hard, but try not to think of food. - Try to visualize a peaceful meadow... I see it. - Under a tree, sits a beautiful girl... Wearing a dress made of bacon.
ga080829 -- I'm not fond of salads... - And they hate me. - DOINK! Stop throwing croutons at me!
ga080830 -- How to lose weight - What a great book! - It's perfect for sneaking snacks. MUNCH MUNCH

ga080831 -- Chicken!
ga080901 -- If you lost a little weight... - ...you'd still be fat. All right! - Dieting is futile!
ga080902 -- Liz is going to call me! - - Any hour now! Be sure to tell her how pathetic you are.
ga080903 -- RING - Meow! - That was Liz. She wanted to talk to you, but I meowed her out of it.

ga080906 -- Fish are fascinating to watch. - Like when they're in a frying pan! - I assume you are taking that to the kitchen?
ga080907 -- RIING - Jon, I have to break our date. We just had an emergency case come into clinic. That's okay, Liz. I understand. - Well, pal, no date. I guess it's just you and me tonight. - - - Boy, does this ever bring back memories, huh? Like a

ga120106 -- Sometimes I wonder... - I wonder what life would be like without you. - Would I be happier? You'll never know.
ga120107 -- Remember the time I stepped on your tail? - The important thing is that YOU remember it. - When the weather is damp, I still walk with a limp.

dr000101 -- How long do we have to stay in the basement, Ralph? Until this Y2K thing blows over! - Trust me, it's pandemonium out there. We might even be the last people on earth! - Fortunately, I've stockpiled enough supplies to last us for a year! -
dr000101 -- Dad, Norman ate all the 'Cheetos'! YOU ATE A YEAR'S SUPPLY OF 'CHEETOS' IN HALF AN HOUR? I had the munchies!
dr000102 -- The year 2000! I can't believe it! - All my life, I've dreamed about what things would be like in the 21st century, and now I know! Dad... - I MADE IT! RALPH DRABBLE HAS LIVED TO SEE THE NEW MILLENIUM!! Dad... - Forgive me foe getting so
dr000102 -- emotional, boys, but this is the greatest experience of my life! Dad. - What? My teacher says that the new millennium and the 21st century don't officially start until 2001! - - YOU MEAN I GOTTA STAY ALIVE FOR ANOTHER WHOLE YEAR??? Sorry.
dr000102 -- Better cut back on the donuts!
dr000103 -- In preparation for the Y2K disaster, I stored enough food down here to last an average family for one year. - Unfortunately, Norman has already eaten all the 'Cheetos'... - And I'm ashamed to admit that I just polished off the beef jerky and
dr000103 -- 'Pop Tards'! - Ralph, what are you saying? For lunch tomorrow, we're going to have to eat the cat!
dr000104 -- As you know, the Y2K bug has thrown the world into chaos. - Since I had the foresight to lead you all to the basement, we are probably the last people alive. - Therefore, I think our first order of business is to appoint a supreme leader of
dr000104 -- planet earth. I believe the choice is clear... - Congratulations, mom! I was talking about ME!!
dr000105 -- Dad, why do we have to stay down here? Trust me, it's bedlam out there! - Madison Avenue has worked people into a frenzy over this Y2K thing. I think there's a lot of money to be made in frightening weak-minded people! - So we'll stay her in
dr000105 -- the storm cellar until things blow over. I didn't even know we had a storm cellar! - We didn't until I brought this official Y2K do-it-yourself storm cellar kit!
dr000106 -- - Hey, the world didn't come to an end! in fact, everything looks pretty normal! - I think we can all come out now, dad! - Good! I was getting pretty gamy! We were only down there for six hours!
dr000107 -- Whoa! It's my arch enemy, the evil SOCKFOOT! - This will be a fight to the finish! - I will bite and scratch and kick and bite some more!! snarl claw! - This cat is very lucky my foot is asleep! I will never let go!! bite bite

dr000109 -- - SLUG BUG! Ow! - What did you hit me for?? I saw a bug car! - It's a fun game, dad! Whenever you see a bug car, you have to slug the person next to you and say "Slug Bug" before he slugs YOU! - That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!
dr000109 -- Don't play childish games like that with me while I'm driving!! - You're almost 20 years old! Mix in some maturity, for cryin' out loud! - Good heavens! There's a time and a place for... - SLUG BUG!
dr000110 -- 'bye, dad! Where do you think YOU'RE going? - To the mall. Not until you put your cap on the right way! - Aww, dad! Everyone wears them like that! Sorry. - The only person who looks good in a backward baseball cap is Yogi Berra! ...Sigh...

dr000114 -- - AWWW!! - Someone got up in the middle of the night and ate all the M&M's in the candy dish! - Who would do such a thing! maybe we have mice! munch munch More like a big rat!
dr000115 -- chuckle chuckle! - - BOOOF! - I should know better than to try to eat soup when I'm watching 'The Munsters'!
dr000116 -- Ralph, before we eat, let's all silently join hands for a few moments. - - - - - - - - - AAUUGHH I guess it's hard for dad to sit still that long when there's food on the table!
dr000117 -- Dad, I have exciting news! - I just found out that the 21st century does not officially start until NEXT YEAR!! Do you know what this means?? - It means there is still a possibility that I could make ESPN's list of the greatest athletes of
dr000117 -- the 20th century!! - I'll be out practicing my Badminton serve, if anyone needs me! there's very little chance anyone will need you.

dr000130 -- Daddy, look at my family homework project! Family homework?? - You guys have to help me decorate these snowflakes! - Read the instructions. - "Using whatever materials you like, decorate the snowflakes to go on display in the classroom." -
dr000130 -- "Some possibilities are: pipe cleaners, colored paper, paint, fabric, feathers, macaroni, beans, crayons, markers, glitter glue, etc. This is supposed to be a fun activity, not an added stress in your life." - HEE HEE HEE HEE What are you

dr000203 -- Ralph, you're going to spoil your dinner! How many pieces of can have you eaten? - Only two or three! If you say two or three, that means nine or ten! - That isn't true! - Tho or three means seven or eight! FIVE OR SIX means nine or ten!
dr000204 -- Hello? - Oh, hello, Norman! - I know you too well. Only YOU would call me and then be too wimpy to say anything. Thanks for calling. Hang up the phone now. - And then wipe that stupid look off your face!
dr000205 -- Wendy thinks I'm a wimp. I need to change her perception of me by doing something bold and daring. - I know! I'll start combing my hair from the opposite side! - - On the other hand, there's no need to go overboard!
dr000206 -- Cats are better than dogs! - Cats are calm, cool and collected! - Cats are aloof! - Cats have dignity! - - - AAAAAHHH They have dignity, until you roll a pingpong ball across the floor!
dr000207 -- scribble scribble scribble What are you writing, Norman? - In honor of Valentine's Day, Wendy, I'm writing a poem about your our relationship! - "Slow dance"..."Sew pants"..."Go ants"... - Huh? I'm trying to give you something that rhymes
dr000207 -- with "no chance".
dr000208 -- I have made the bold decision to give Wendy a Valentine's card! - Are you going to sign it? Of course I'm going to sign it! - Let's see, now...how should I sign a Valentine's card to the woman I love? - Best regards, Norman J. Drabble. (The
dr000208 -- guy who sits next to you in world history) That ought to melt her heart!
dr000209 -- What's that?? - A Valentine's card?? - Happy ***** day to the woman I ****. I **** you more than *** *** and I am ***** to **** you *******! - I edited out all the embarrassing parts! How wimpy can you get??
dr000210 -- Wendy thinks I'm a complete wimp. - Won't she be surprised at the courage I display by giving her a box of candy for Valentine's day! - - Although, I suppose throwing it in her yard and running away isn't the most romantic approach!
dr000211 -- *Ahem* Wendy...as you know...uh...well...Valentine's day is coming up...so...uh... - I was wondering...well...I mean...I was thinking...um...if you'd like to...uh...well...see... - That is...if you're not busy...uh...well, maybe we
dr000211 -- could...you know...sort of...well... - Maybe...you know...sort of...uh...errr... Back in 15 Minutes
dr000212 -- Norman, I'm going out on Valentine's day... - Since you'll be home, will you record a TV show for me on your VCR? - What makes you think I'LL be home on Valentine's day?? - Call it a hunch. Nice hunch.
dr000213 -- ! - skattle skattle skattle skattle - skattle skattle skattle skattle - skattle skattle skattle - skattle skattle skattle - I thought ducks were supposed to flee in terror when a dog comes running at them! That was running?
dr000214 -- You wanted some fatherly advice, son? Yes, dad... - Wendy thinks I'm a wimp, and I don't know how to change her opinion of me. - Son, my advice to you is to be bold! Don't be afraid to ask for a date! She may say no, but she can't call you a
dr000214 -- WIMP anymore! - A LOSER, maybe, but not a WIMP! "Loser" would be an improvement!
dr000215 -- Wendy...will you...uh...what I'm trying to say is...will you...uh... SIGH - Be bold, son! - Will you marry me? - MARRY you? I said BOLD, not INSANE!!!
dr000216 -- That's right, I just proposed marriage! Pretty bold and daring, isn't it?! - I guess that blows your theory that I'm a wimp, doesn't it?! - So what do you say, Wendy? Yes or no?? - Yes. HA! I knew you'd say no because you...WHAT??!!
dr000217 -- Did you just accept my marriage proposal??? On the condition that we elope to Las Vegas immediately! - Why???? Because I know you'll wimp out! The only question is how long it will take you! - Let's go! I'm betting you'll wimp out  before we
dr000217 -- even get in the car! Well, you're wrong! - I refuse to wimp-out until we're at least out of the parking garage!
dr000218 -- I can't believe you want to marry me! I DON'T want to marry you. - The only reason I accepted your marriage proposal was to call your bluff! - I have no doubt that you'll wimp out before we get to Las Vegas! - Three things in life a certain:
dr000218 -- death, taxes, and Norman Drabble will wimp out! That's it! I could fake my own death!
dr000219 -- Hello? ...oh, hi, Norm! Where are you? - BARSTOW?? What are you doing in Barstow?? - ...you're on your way to Las Vegas to get married? Wow, congratulations! - I gotta go, Norm. Your mom just fainted. Drop a nickel in the slot machine for me,
dr000219 -- OK?
dr000220 -- Good morning, Nor... - DO NOT SAY ANOTHER WORD!!! - I crammed all night for today's exam, and my brain is now filled to capacity! - I cannot squeeze another bit of information into my head! - If one more thought enters my mind, it will
dr000220 -- displace something that's already in there! - I took a bubble bath last night. Rats! There went the Kansas-Nebraska Act!
dr000221 -- My fiancee and I would each like a chocolate shake, please! - Oh, you're engaged? We're on our way to Las Vegas to get married! - Not really. I only accepted his proposal because I know he'll  wimp out, thus proving once and for all that he's
dr000221 -- the biggest wimp on the face of the earth! - Whatever! Do you mind if my pet duck comes to live with us, darling?
dr000222 -- Norman, we're about to cross the Nevada state line. Don't you feel the slightest urge to wimp out, yet? Nope. - I fact, I've been thinking...after we get married, we're going to need a place to live. - Can we move in with YOUR parents? - I
dr000222 -- don't think you'd like living with mine, on account of my dad likes to walk around in the house in his underwear! As soon as you feel like wimping out, go for it!
dr000223 -- I can't believe we're in Las Vegas. And there's a wedding chapel! - The "Burnin' Love Marriage Chapel"! Marriages performed by an authentic Elvis impersonator! Come on, let's go! - Hi! _If we pay you in cash, will you marry us right now?
dr000223 -- Uh-huh! - Right this way, y'all! I'm impressed, Norman. You're obviously going to wait until the last second to wimp out!
dr000224 -- Do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband? Oh, sure. - And do you, Norman, take this woman... Norman, it's OK to wimp out, now! You've proven your point! - To be your lawfully wedded wife? I promise never to call you a wimp
dr000224 -- again! You da'man! Now call it off and let's go home! - I do. I now pronounce y'all husband and wife! AAAUUGH!!
dr000225 -- You may kiss the bride. NO, HE MAYN'T!! I "mayn't"? - This can't be happening! Please tell me I didn't just marry Norman Drabble! Please, please tell me we're not married!! - Y'all are married! Have a nice day, now! - I WANT A DIVORCE!! What,
dr000225 -- and throw away the best 20 seconds of our lives??
dr000226 -- I can't believe we got MARRIED!! How are we going to get out of this?? - Wendy, Wendy, Wendy...relax! There's a simple explanation  for all of this! Isn't it obvious? This is all a... - Editor's Note: Cartoonist is hereby reminded that this
dr000226 -- storyline may not end as another "Dream Sequence". According to contractual agreement, if the cartoonist draws himself into a corner, he may resort to lame "Dream Sequence" ending only once every ten years. So, don't even THINK about it! -
dr000226 -- Never mind! My life is over.
dr000227 -- Every golfer needs a good caddie. - A good caddie knows the game of golf forwards and backwards. - A good caddie knows what the golfer wants almost instinctively! They are one of mind. - Give me a sand wedge, Norm. - Right! - - ? - Is ham and
dr000227 -- cheese OK? ...Sigh...
dr000228 -- Rats! I'm down 35 cents! Sorry, Wendy. This isn't a good day to begin marriage! - Cocktails! Cocktails! Would you care for a cocktail, ma'am? - BUZZ OFF, BLONDIE! I'VE GOT A LOT ON MY MIND!! - I apologize for my wife. She's a bit uptight
dr000228 -- because we just accidentally got married! His wife! Happens all the time!
dr000229 -- I can't believe we got married! Why didn't you wimp out like you were supposed to do?? Wendy, one day, I'm sure we'll look back on this and laugh! - Ladies and gentlemen...I've been told we have newlyweds dining with us tonight... -
dr000229 -- Congratulations, Mr. and Mrs. Drabble! - Sorry to make a scene, but that pushed me over the edge. I sure hope this town has an accordeon repairman!
dr000301 -- This is a nightmare! By a cruel twist of fate, I find myself in Las Vegas, married to Norman Drabble! - Maybe if I remain calm, I'll be able to think of a reasonable solution to all this. - I've got it! - Where are you going? The MIRAGE to
dr000301 -- throw myself into a volcano!
dr000302 -- I can't believe I'm married to Norman Drabble. My worst nightmare has become a reality. My life is ruined. - Maybe it's not so bad. Maybe I could make it work... - Maybe it won't be so horrible being married to Norman. - Wendy, guess what!
dr000302 -- This hotel has an arcade! I think I'll go back to the wedding chapel and plead insanity!
dr000303 -- Hello...you've got to help us! We got married here earlier today, and... You did? Why don't I recognize you? - We were married by a different Elvis impersonator. Oh, no... - Weldon, did you... I'm sorry, daddy,,,they wanted to get hitched
dr000303 -- right away, and you were at lunch, so I... - Folks, Weldon, here, is not an ordained Elvis impersonator. I'm afraid you're not legally married! So, should we do it over? NO!
dr000304 -- What a relief not to be married to you! - I feel like I've been granted a REPRIEVE! I will never again take for granted a moment of my life that I am unmarried with you! - Thank you for messing everything up, Norman! - You've made me the
dr000304 -- happiest woman in the world! I should've married you sooner!
dr000305 -- Look what I've got, Oogie! The laser pointer! - What's that?! It's a bug!! - Whoa! - It's alive!! - Where'd it go? click! - There it is! Go get it!! scramble scramble scramble - It's amazing how such a simple thing can occupy that tiny mind
dr000305 -- for hours! - I guess cats are pretty stupid. I was talking about your father!
dr000306 -- I love this game show! Contestants, put these donuts in order of size, starting with the smallest: A: Long John B: Plain C: Donut Hole D: Twist - The correct order is: C.B.D.A! And the winner is... - RALPH DRABBLE!! - YAY, DAD!! I love you,
dr000306 -- Regis. Put me down!
dr000307 -- Ralph, here's your first question for $100...Humpty Dumpty sat on what? A: Roof B: Wall C: Tack D: Whoopee Cushion - Hm...history isn't my best subject, Regis! - I think I'll use my "50:50" lifeline. In the first question?? All right, take
dr000307 -- away two answers, please! - Ralph, the correct answer is either "wall" or "whoopee cushion". Darn! Those were the two I couldn't decide between!
dr000308 -- I think I'd like to poll the audience, Regis! You want to use your SECOND LIFELINE on your FIRST QUESTION?? - OK, audience, Ralph needs your help. Did Humpty Dumpty sit on (B.) a wall, or (D.) a whoopee cushion? Please vote now! - The results
dr000308 -- are in, Ralph. 100% of the audience says the correct answer is "B". - This audience looks pretty stupid tome, Regis. I think I'd like to use another lifeline!
dr000309 -- Regis, I think I need to use my last lifeline! - You're going to use up all your lifelines on the FIRST QUESTION?? This is highly unusual, Ralph! - I know, but I think I'll call  my young son, Patrick. He's a lot smarter than I am! Then
dr000309 -- again, who isn't? MOM, YOU NEED TO GET OFF THE PHONE FOR A FEW MINUTES!
dr000310 -- Patrick, we've got 30 seconds! Humpty Dumpty sat on what? A wall or a woopee cushion?? Before I give you the answer, dad, how much of the money will I get? - Money?? Oh...uh...OK, I'll give you ten percent! No deal. We split it fifty-fifty!
dr000310 -- Take it or leave it! - ALL RIGTH!! FIFTY-FIFTY!! NOW WHAT'S THE ANSWER?? Just kidding! The correct answer is... - BZZZT!! Sorry, Ralph. You ran out of time! AAUGGH! Boy, are you gonna be in trouble!
dr000311 -- Ralph, you've used up all three of your lifelines, and you still haven't answered the FIRST QUESTION! - I know, Regis, and I think I'm going to quit now and walk away! - Walk away?? But you haven't won any money yet!! I think it's better to
dr000311 -- quit now than to risk the indignity of losing on the first question. - Besides, that pulsating background music is giving me a headache! click
dr000312 -- Boy, am I exhausted! Why? - Because daddy had a hard day at work, Penny! Why? - Things were hectic! Why? - You know, Penny...daddy doesn't like it when you ask "why" all the time! Why? - Well, because it's not necessary for me to explain
dr000312 -- everything! Why? - Because little kids don't need to know everything that's going on! Why? - Because some things don't concern you! Why? - Mommy, I need help in here! Why?
dr000313 -- - - - I thought you said this was "Pajama Day" My mistake!
dr000314 -- All right, Patrick...suppose you're playing catcher, and the runner tries to steal... - You spring to your feet and... - Whoa! - ...get real dizzy! I guess this explains why there aren't many middle-aged catchers.
dr000315 -- I hate to tell you this, Wally, but you have an appointment with the vet. ! - skattle skattle skattle skattle skattle - It's no use trying to flee. - Especially in your case! skattle skattle skattle skattle skattle
dr000316 -- Wally! You're back from the vet! That wasn't so bad, was it? - If you ask me, that vet was a little pushy!
dr000317 -- Crime, greed, assault, murder and mayhem! That's all they talk about anymore! - It makes me depressed! - If it depresses you so much, why do you watch the news?? - This is the SPORTS REPORT!!
dr000318 -- Wendy says that I'm easy to ignore. - She says that's why nobody ever pays attention to me. - Do you think I'm easy to ignore, dad? - Dad?
dr000319 -- My wife is talking about something, but I have no idea what. - That's because I tuned out a while back. The trick is to make it look like I'm still listening. - There are several methods...for example, if she smiles, I smile! - If she frowns,
dr000319 -- I frown. - Stroking my chin while staring into space gives the impression that I'm pondering her words. - A few non-committal verbal reactions are also helpful. Is that right? You don't say! Uh-huh... - Finally good eye contact is a must! -
dr000319 -- The key to a successful relationship is to always act like you're paying attention!
dr000320 -- Ralph, how would you like to go to a dinner party at the Smiths' on Friday night? - I'd hat it. It's that last thing on earth I'd want to do. - I'd rather be tied to an ant hill naked. Let me rephrase the question. - We're going to the
dr000320 -- Smiths' dinner party on Friday night! I hate it when she rephrases the question.
dr000321 -- Ralph, why don't you want to go th the Smiths' party?? I hate parties, honeybunch! - I'm just not a "people person". - That's all right... - None of them are "grunt-head persons", so you'll all be even!
dr000322 -- Honeybunch, you'd better call the Smiths and tell them I probably won't be able to attend their dinner party! Why? - I think I might be coming down with something! Like what? - Well, let's see...today is Wednesday morning...the party is
dr000322 -- Friday night... - Hopefully, it's a case of the 72-hour flu!
dr000323 -- Drabble! What are YOU doing here?? - I heard you had a bad case of the flu, Steinbauer, so I rushed right over! Why?? - Because my wife is making me go to some dumb party on Friday, and I'm hoping I'll get sick so I won't have to go! - Feel
dr000323 -- free to sneeze in my direction!
dr000324 -- All right, Ralph, you win! I guess you can't go to the party if you can't even get out of bed! I'll go by myself! - SLAM! - - Just as I suspected. Get your clothes and let's go!
dr000325 -- I must admit, honeybunch, I actually had a good time at the party tonight! - I can't believe you tried to catch a cold in order to avoid going! - Heh! Heh! Thank goodness it didn't work! - ASHOO! I'll go plug in the humidifier!
dr000326 -- I think I'll take a few laps around the track! - Hello! Hello! - - Hello, again! Hello, again! - - - - Cough! Cough! Cough! Cough! - There ought to be a rule that everyone jogging around a track has to go in the same direction!
dr000327 -- Rock music...rock music...rock music...who changed all my radio buttons?? punch punch punch - I did, dad! When did you do that? - This morning when I drove to the cleaners! - You reprogrammed my radio buttons for a THREE-MILE DRIVE?? I almost
dr000327 -- got the car painted, but it was too expensive.
dr000328 -- Come on, Patrick...burn a fastball in here! - Here we go...show me some heat, baby! - WHOA!! - My shins just flashed before my eyes!
dr000329 -- Hi, Wendy! - Wendy?? Huh?? - Oh, sorry, Norman! I didn't mean to ignore you! - It's just that you're so highly ignorable!
dr000330 -- Before I putt, I need to remove the pin. - putt! - Yes!! What a putt! It stopped only an inch past the hole!! - Imagine that!
dr000331 -- Daddy, mommy isn't home, so I'll ask YOU this question... - Can I have a cupcake? Sure. - REALLY?? THANK YOU, DADDY!! - Something tells me that's not the answer mommy would have given! Daddy is the greatest! Daddy is great!

dr000429 -- Have you ever considered a part-time job, Norm? - Wouldn't you be proud to be gainfully employed? - I prefer to think of myself as a stay-at-home son!
dr000430 -- Nothing is more enjoyable on the weekend than lounging around the house in a t-shirt. - - - Hmm... - What?? Oh, nothing... - For some reason, it just occurred to me that I haven't gone skiing for quite a while!

dr000521 -- RATS! Something wrong, Norm? - I'd like to take a nap, dad, but I can't sleep because it's so sunny in here! - Hold on, Norm! I know what might help... - Here, wear this bundfold over your eyes! - OK! Nighty-night! - Dad! It didn't work! -
dr000521 -- Why did you cut holes in it? I'm afraid of the dark!
dr000522 -- Isn't this fun, Ralph? We're both reading books before we go to sleep! - I love reading. I find it very relaxing. It's a nice way to end the day! - My book was on the bestseller list for eight months! My friend Kathy recommended it! - What's

dr000528 -- Whoever said "No man is an island" never saw dad in the pool!
dr000529 -- Hello, I'm Ralph Drabble. - I'm here for my 2:30 doctor's appointment. - 2:30?? It's now 3:45!! - We don't get around to our 2:30 appointments until at least 4:15! I like to be early.
dr000530 -- The doctor will see you shortly, Mr. Drabble. Please have a seat. - - - Why did you bring your own chair? I don't want to sit in seats that a bunch of sick people have sat in!
dr000531 -- Having an aquarium in a doctor's waiting room is a good idea. - Aquariums are tranquil. They promote a sense of peace and well-being. It has a reassuring effect on patients. - - How come there are no fish in there? They all died!
dr000601 -- - - - I thought you said the doctor would be right in! GET BACK IN YOUR LITTLE ROOM!
dr000602 -- Hello, Mr. Drabble! How can I help you? - Well, doc, I've got a little cough, and I... - Why are you standing way out there? - I'm leaving for a vacation in Tahiti tomorrow, and I don't want to get sick! Now, hold the stethoscope to your
dr000602 -- chest!
dr000603 -- How did it go at the doctor's office, Ralph? Is everything OK? - I spent the past month worrying that I was deathly ill... - So I finally mustered the courage to see the doctor, and it turns out I've been worrying for nothing! - Most people

dr000604 -- ...and then Britanny said "I was sitting there first!" and I said "Nah-ahh!" - And then I said "Do you want to play ropes?" and she said "Only if Megan plays!" ...Sigh... - ...but then, after recess, Megan asked if she could borrow my
dr000604 -- crayons, so I... Penny, excuse me... - I know you like to talk, but you need to learn that it isn't necessary to tell daddy every little detail of your life, because I...because... - Tell me all about your date, Penny! Daddy, you don't need
dr000604 -- to know every little detail of my life! - Sorry, Penny. Disregard my last comment. Please continue!
dr000605 -- OK, dad...our sunglasses are in place. Go ahead! - WHOA, THAT'S BRIGHT!! Gimme a break! It was a long winter!
dr000606 -- Oh, no...say it isn't so! - My worst fear is about to come true... - My friends surround me, it's time to go home from school... - And DAD is driving the carpool! I hope everyone likes the GOLDEN OLDIES station!
dr000607 -- Dad is driving the carpool today, and I'm afraid he's going to embarrass me. - He'll probably try to be funny, and my friends will just think he's weird. - He hasn't said anything yet. Maybe he senses my concern and he's keeping quiet on
dr000607 -- purpose. - Who wants to hear my Daffy Duck impression? This is going to be the longest three miles of my life!
dr000608 -- Mom, why did you let dad drive the carpool?! - He embarrassed me infront of my peers! - Son, it's a father's sacred duty to embarrass his children. One day, you'll embarrass YOUR children, and the circle of life will be complete! - Why did
dr000608 -- you have to tell everyone I like the Teletubbies? What's wrong with the Teletubbies?
dr000609 -- Oh, no...it looks like dad's driving the carpool, again! - Mom said not to worry... - She said she'd make sure he wouldn't embarrass me again. - Thanks, mom!
dr000610 -- - My handwriting is getting worse as I get older... - It used to be that nobody else could read it. - Now I can't even read it!
dr000611 -- Hey, doc! How ya doin'? - You do recognize me, don't you? - I'm sorry...I'm drawing a blank! I'm Ralph! Ralph Drabble!! - YOU'RE MY DENTIST!! - I've been a patient of yours for 20 YEARS!! Gee, I'm sorry! Please forgive me! - I can't believe
dr000611 -- it! I just ran into my own dentist, and he didn't even RECOGNIZE me! - Be fair, Ralph...you may have been his patient for 20 years, but you've only gone in to see him TWICE!! That reminds me...I think I'm due for my seven year checkup!
dr000612 -- - - CRUNCH!! - Do we have any more potato chips? I hope not.
dr000613 -- Ralph, don't take such big bites! - Your sandwich isn't going to run away! Don't inhale it! You're liable to choke to death! - If you took smaller bites, you'd enjoy your food a lot more! - Honeybunch, telling me how to eat is like telling
dr000613 -- Sammy Sosa how to hit home runs!
dr000614 -- Here's your fried chicken, Ralph! - Now, remember, I want you to eat more slowly! - Instead of taking huge bites and scarfing everything down, try to take your... - time. Whoops! I think I just swallowed my moist towelette!
dr000615 -- YOU'RE A LOUSY UMPIRE, STEINBAUER! - YOU OUGHT TO HAVE YOUR EYES EXAMINED!! - YOU'RE A DISGRACE TO LITTLE LEAGUE!! - The game hasn't even started yet, Ralph! This is just my pre-game warm-up!
dr000616 -- I have an announcement to make! - No one is allowed to mention the name STEINBAUER in this house ever again!! - Steinbauer? What did Steinbauer do?? Steinbauer?? You mean Mr. Steinbauer, our neighbor? Steinbauer?? What's so bad about Mr.
dr000616 -- Steinbauer? ...Sigh...
dr000617 -- Ralph, calm down and tell me why you're so angry at Mr. Steinbauer! - He umpired Patrick's little league game, and called him out at first when he was clearly safe! - Actually, dad, I looked out to me, too! I had a better view of it, son. -
dr000617 -- Better view?? You were in line at the snack bar! YOU CAN SEE A LOT FROM THE SNACK BAR!!
dr000618 -- Happy father's day, dad!! - What the heck is this? It's a utility belt for fathers! - It holds everything a dad ever needs... - Like holsters for each of your TV clickers! Wow! You'll never lose them again! - And over here is your own
dr000618 -- personal ice cream scooper! Crackers and a can of aerosol cheese! - And this is your money changer! You'll always have the exact change! Cool! - Back here are compartments for gum, sunglasses, and golf tees! And this, I predict, will be your
dr000618 -- favorite feature. What is it? - A donut holder! I LOVE YOU GUYS!
dr000619 -- Honeybunch, where is my scuba gear? - in the hall closet. Thank you. - Are you going swimming? Nope. - Barbecuing!
dr000620 -- FIRE!! - I'll save you, Ralph! Aaaaarrg! - On second thought, every man for himself!
dr000621 -- Steinbauer! What are you doing in my back yard?? I saw smoke and I thought your house was on fire! - I didn't realize it was just your barbecue out of control! - Out of control?? This fire is perfect! It's just the fright temperature to... -
dr000621 -- melt my spatula!
dr000622 -- Sorry, Ralph...when I saw all the smoke, I thought you needed to be rescued! - YOU rescue ME?? I can't imagine anything more humiliating than having my life saved by you, Steinbauer! - That'll be the day, when I need YOU to rescue ME! HA! -
dr000622 -- Fine. I'm leaving. AAKKKK!
dr000623 -- All right! I'm going! I'm going! aakkk! tap tap tap! - Quit tapping me on the...hey, is something wrong? Wheeze! - You have a strange look about you. Are you choking or something?? - You MUST be choking! I've never heard you keep quiet for so
dr000623 -- long!
dr000624 -- You're choking on your Hot Dog, Ralph? That'll teach you not to eat so fast! aakk! - Stand still and I'll give you the Heimlich maneuver! - All I have to do is wrap my arms around your stomach and...whoa, that's a long way around, isn't it? -
dr000624 -- Where's Shaquille O'Neal when you need him?
dr000625 -- - - ? - - scratch scratch! - - My best guess would be that you came in this room to check the TV guide. Oh, yeah! That's why I came in here! - Reason #352 why middle-age men need wives!
dr000626 -- Hi! I'm Ralph Drabble! I'm currently having an out-of-body experience! - That's because I'm choking to death on a weenie. Steinbauer is trying to save my life! If this doesn't work, can I have your bowling ball? - My family looks on with
dr000626 -- concern... Hey, it looks like dad is choking to death in the back yard! Darn! He WOULD have to do this just as I'm leaving for Bunco! - You don't see this kind of drama in "Dilbert"!
dr000627 -- FFOOO! - Whoa! I thought I was a goner! Gasp! - Steinbauer! You saved my life! I am forever in your debt! - Rats! Mind if I start parking my R.V. in front of your house?
dr000628 -- Ralph, considering Mr. Steinbauer just saved your life, I don't think you're being very gracious about it! - Honeybunch, you don't understand...this is AWFUL! Now he's going to hold it over my head forever!! - Ralph, I can't believe you'd say
dr000628 -- such a thing about me! - ...considering I saved your life and all! SEE?
dr000629 -- Local resident G.W. Steinbauer is a hero tonight, after saving the life of his neighbor, Ralph Drabble, who was choking on a hot dog. - "He was eating too fast and he began to choke. With total disregard for my own personal safety, I
dr000629 -- administered the Heimlich maneuver." - "Mr. Drabble, how does it feel to live next door to a hero?" "Aw, shut up!" - "Mr. Steinbauer, is your neighbor always this disagreeable?" "Pretty much." I hate the media.
dr000630 -- I don't believe it! Steinbauer is letting his dog dig in our yard again! - HEY, STEINBAUER! GET YOUR STUPID DOG OUT OF MY... Ralph, shame on you! - Mr. Steinbauer saved your life! Don't raise your voice to him! - Have a nice day! Why are all
dr000630 -- the veins in dad's neck sticking out?
dr000701 -- Ralph! What brings you to my door at this hour?? - Steinbauer, it's two a.m.! Could you please quit playing with your drum set? - Oh, sure...I save YOUR life, and now you're making demands! - The thanks I get for being a hero! I give up.
dr000702 -- Ralph, look! Oogie is going to fall! - She's leaning over the edge and she's going to fall! So? - So CATCH her! CATCH her?? - Stand underneath with your arms out and catch her when she falls! But... - - Poor Oogie! At least he broke our fall!
dr000702 -- I need a really long band-aid.
dr000703 -- Ralph, my niece, Brittany, is selling girl scout cookies. - I put you down for 50 boxes. Considering I saved your life, i figured it's the least you'd want to do! - 50 BOXES?? THAT'S RIDICULOUS!! - He's right. Put him down for 75!
dr000704 -- Ever since Steinbauer saved my life, he's been making me feel miserable about it! - Maybe you ought to save HIS life, and then you'd be even! Hey, I have an idea... - Maybe I ought to save HIS life, and then we'd be even! - That's the
dr000704 -- stupidest idea I've ever heard! Where's the nearest quicksand?
dr000705 -- Hello, TV newsroom? I'd like to report a daring and heroic rescue at sea! - Ralph Drabble single-handedly saved the life of his fishing companion, G.W. Steinbauer! Send your news crew to Lake McGarry for interviews! - When did it happen? - In
dr000705 -- about twenty minutes! I'm ready to go, Ralph!
dr000706 -- Nice of you to invite me fishing, Ralph! It's the least I can do for the man who saved my life! - Odd that you didn't bring a fishing pole, though! - I was afraid I'd lose it if the boat just happened to tip over! - Why on earth would...hey,
dr000706 -- what are you doing?? Rock-A-Bye Baby In The Tree Top...
dr000707 -- SPLOOSH! Man overboard!! - I'll save you, Steinbauer!! - glug! glug! - I'll save you, Ralph! - No, I'LL save YOU!! YOU'RE the one who need saving!! I do not!! splash! splash! splash!
dr000708 -- Hi, I'm Ralph Drabble! I'm having another out-of-body experience! - I intended to save Steinbauer's life so we'd be even. Instead, he's saving MY life again! ...out with the bad air, in with the good... - How could this get any worse?? - And
dr000708 -- now for some mouth-to-mouth resuscitation... AAAAAHHH!!
dr000709 -- Look at the flock of birds, Ralph! Isn't it amazing? - Look at how they all fly in formation, and then suddenly, at the exact same moment, they all turn in a different direction! - How do they know to do that at precisely the same time? - It
dr000709 -- must be instinct. Yeah, like our kids. - Our kids?? What do you mean? - How do they always know to start talking to us at the exact same moment? Dad will you take me to....tomorrow? How much longer are we going to stay here?
dr000710 -- My plan backfired. - I wanted to save Steinbauer's life so we'd be even. Instead, he saved MY life again! - Being pulled ashore and given mouth-to-mouth resuscitation by Steinbauer was the most humiliating experience of my life! - What about

dr000714 -- So you think men have an innate desire to barbecue?? Absolutely! - When cooking meat outdoors over an open fire, I feel a special kinship with my primitive ancestors! - Primitive ancestors? - You mean, like uncle Larry? No, even more

dr001024 -- What are you doing under the sink, dad? I'm looking for the Halloween candy! - Every year, your mom hides the candy from me, and I always take pride in finding it! - But she's outside herself this year. I can't find it anywhere! - It hasn't
dr001024 -- been a total loss, though...I found the missing easter egg!
dr001025 -- All right, where is it? Where's what? - The Halloween candy! Every year you hide it so I won't get into it, and every year I find it! - But this year you did y really good job, so just tell me where you hid it! - So you're admitting defeat?
dr001025 -- The attic! I forgot to check the attic!
dr001026 -- A DIVINING ROD?? I'm a desperate man! - I was hoping it would lead me to your stash of Halloween candy, but it's no use. - Ralph, I'll be glad to tell you where I hid the candy. You will?? - Sure, all you have to do is admit that I'm much
dr001026 -- more clever than you are! NEVER!
dr001027 -- Admit it, Ralph! You're a beaten man! - You tried your best, but you could not find where I hid the Halloween candy! - Mom, it's really weird...I put some clothes in the dryer, and they came out all CHOCOLATY! - YOU USED THE DRYER??! The one
dr001027 -- place I didn't look!
dr001028 -- I can't think of anything to be for Halloween. How about a mummy? - I've been that before. How about Superman? Been that. Frankenstein? - Been that. A vampire? Been that. Batman? Been that. - It's no use, dad. I've already BEEN everything! I
dr001028 -- suppose this is a common problem for people who trick-or-treat into their twenties!
dr001029 -- Here's what happened... - I got up in the middle of the night for a drink of water... Yawn! - I went into the kitchen, and there was daddy, eating all the Halloween candy! click! Uh-oh! - I said... You're not supposed to eat that candy, daddy!
dr001029 -- It's for the trick-or-treaters! Gulp! - And daddy said... Now Penny, this isn't the way it looks! - And then he said...I'm not really eating the candy! You're just having a dream! None of this is really happening! Now go back to bed! - ...and
dr001029 -- that's why most of the candy is gone! Ralph, you told me you woke up and found the DOG eating the candy! - Whose version are you going to believe, MINE or a CHILD'S?
dr001030 -- Trick or treat! - Kids, I believe that honesty is the best policy... - So I have a confession to make... - He ate all the candy again. Now don't get ahead of me!
dr001031 -- Trick or treat! - Candy?? For me?? Why, thank you! - I'll take this one! - I love the holidays! No wonder our windows always get soaped!
dr001101 -- - - Whaddaya think? I think somebody's had too much sugar! Who ate all my Halloween candy??!!
dr001102 -- HAAHHHH - sniff sniff! - Eewww! My breath smells terrible!! - sniff sniff! - Oh, good...it was just my hand! Check, please!
dr001103 -- ...35...36...37...38! I have exactly 38 french fries left! - I'm going to refill my lemonade, daddy. - And I better still have 38 french fries when I get back! - They grow up so fast!
dr001104 -- Dad, how would you describe this glass of water? - Half empty. I KNEW you'd say that! - Saying the glass is "half empty" instead of "half full" indicates that you're pessimistic, gloomy, negative, and less intelligent! - Now I say that it's
dr001104 -- totally empty!
dr001105 -- I think youth sports would be better if the parents stayed home. - Parents take things way too seriously. They get too wrapped up in winning and losing! - Why can't they just relax and let the kids have fun? - Oh-oh...it's a breakaway for the
dr001105 -- other team! They're going to score a goal! - TRIP! - What were we talking about? It doesn't matter.
dr001106 -- Ralph, go out to the garage and get our box of thanksgiving decorations. - We have thanksgiving decorations?? Follow me. I'll show you. - See? There they are... - Right behind the box of labor day decorations! We have LABOR DAY DECORATIONS??
dr001107 -- Why do they always call it "tomato" ketchup?? - Isn't it redundant? What other kind of ketchup IS there?? - There isn't watermelon ketchup or mango ketchup! - And another thing: Why do they call it "orange" juice when it's yellow?? So many
dr001107 -- questions, so little brainpower!
dr001108 -- - Can I help you find something? - Do I LOOK lost? - Well, as a matter of fact... Can I help you find something?
dr001109 -- Excuse me...Do you have the time? Yes. It's 4:45! - 4:45?? Oh, wait...I put my watch on upside down. - It's 10:15. - I sure hope noone else asks me for the time today! brush brush!
dr001110 -- How do you like my new nail polish? - Very nice! - - I had a Volkswagen that color!
dr001111 -- Mom, can I pour a glass of milk? - Norman, it's "MAY I pour a glass of milk?" - May I pour a glass of milk? Certainly. - Oops! He had the question right the first time!
dr001112 -- ...chatter chatter chatter yakitty yak yak chitter chatter... SIGH - Penny, I know you have a lot to say, but I'm going to give you a little advice... - You have two eyes, two ears, and only ONE mouth... - That means you should look and
dr001112 -- listen TWICE as much as you talk! Oh... - Then I should also SMELL twice much, because I have TWO NOSTRILS! Well, I guess that's... - And I should WALK twice as much because I have TWO FEET! And I should CLAP twice as much because I have TWO
dr001112 -- hands! - And I should wiggle my toes TEN times as much because... SIGH
dr001113 -- RING I'll get it, mom! - Hello? - Sorry, I'm not interested. - Aren't those phone solicitors annoying? That was Norman!
dr001114 -- Class, please come to order! - May I have your attention, class? It's now MY turn to talk! - I hate "Parents Night"! Z
dr001115 -- Parents, you'll find a sheet of paper on your child's desk. - We'd like all of you to write a personal note to your children that they can read tomorrow! - ****!!**!* What's all the commotion at table six! - HE'S COPYING!! AM NOT!!
dr001116 -- - - Oh! Oh! - Mr. Drabble, did you have a question? Yeah, but now I forgot!
dr001117 -- Dad, please don't tell me you embarrassed me at "parents night". - Please don't tell me you offended my teacher, and that I should now avoid eye contact. - Please don't tell me that the evening was a total disaster! - OK, I won't. Why don't I
dr001117 -- feel reassured?
dr001118 -- "It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas"... - Actually, that's not true... - Here at the mall, it's been looking a lot like Christmas for at least three months!
dr001119 -- Hello, is this newsradio's traffic hotline? Tipster Drabble, here! - I just turned onto main street, and I find myself in the middle of a serious traffic problem! - There's bedlam in the street! People are sitting atop their cars, animals

dr001121 -- look in the mirror!
dr001122 -- Honeybunch, it's working like a charm! - Pretending that we're mad at each other has No-Neck feeling lucky his wife left him! - So, when will thanksgiving dinner be ready? You told him I'm a lousy cook, so fix it yourself, grunt head! - Ha
dr001122 -- ha! That's a good one, honeybunch, but save the zingers for No-Neck can hear them!

dr001128 -- - - FLUSH - Now I know why they call it the wee hours!
dr001129 -- - - munch munch! - Rats! I hate it when my ice cream is all gone! Me too, 'cause now she's gonna start talking again!

dr001206 -- Ralph, this tree isn't fresh. I want you to take it back to the lot! Are you out of your mind?? - What kind of LUNATIC returns a Christmas tree?? You'll just have to make the best of it! - Here's a novel idea...just turn the ugly side to the
dr001206 -- wall! - It didn't help. You're a funny, funny woman.
dr001207 -- Dad, what are you doing? Picking up needles off the floor. - Your mom is convinced this tree is dead, and she wants me to return it to the lot tomorrow! - That's the LAST thing I want to do, so I'm going to try to convince her it's still
dr001207 -- fresh! - Can I do something to help? Yeah, go out to the garage and get me some green spray paint!
dr001208 -- Ralph, I want you to take this tree back to the lot! It's not drinking any water! - Are you sure, honeybunch? I'll just go down here and check... - SLURP! - The pan is dry, honeybunch! This tree's drinkin' like a FISH!

dr001209 -- dead man. Return the tree!
dr001210 -- Hey, what are you doing?? click click click - I'm setting your digital clock to the correct time! It was way off! No, it wasn't! It was perfect!! - It used to be three minutes slow. Then I set it ahead ten minuted so I'd never be late. - Then
dr001210 -- I forgot to turn it back an hour last fall when daylight savings time ended. - And then Penny accidentally kicked the button and set it back another 15 MINUTES! - I never bothered to reset it because I knew the correct time was exactly 82
dr001210 -- minutes ahead of what the clock said! - But now that you've set it to the right time, I'll NEVER know what time it is!! Why can I never do anything right?
dr001211 -- I need a box of garland for our Christmas tree. - Now how can I tell if there's enough garland in the box to go around our tree? - Yes, that should be enough!

dr001218 -- YET??
dr001219 -- Hey, it's the SWEATER I asked for! This must be what Ralph is giving me for Christmas! - Now I wish I'd asked for the one with the floral print. - - I can't believe it. She exchanged a gift she hasn't even RECEIVED yet!
dr001220 -- ...one nose hair trimmer, one exercise video, one pack of breath mints! - Who says dad's a hard man to shop for?? Merry Christmas!
dr001221 -- ...if one of those bottles should happen to fall, 24 bottles of beer on the wall - Maybe "caroling mall cops" wasn't such a good idea. We probably should've learned a Christmas song! Tips
dr001222 -- Wow! Someone left us a dozen Christmas cookies! - Ralph, these cookies aren't for us, they're for the STEINBAUERS! - They were left on our porch by mistake! Go take them to their rightful owner! - Here, Steinbauer, someone left you
dr001222 -- half-a-dozen Christmas cookies!
dr001223 -- Honeybunch, remember the watch I told you I wanted for Christmas? Yes... - Well, I changed my mind. I think I'd rather have this one! - You're changing your mind TWO DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS?? - ARRRGGHH She sure gets uptight as the holidays
dr001223 -- grow near!
dr001224 -- A plate of rice cookies and a glass of water?? I thought Santa liked cookies and cocoa! - He does, but believe me, Santa has really been putting on the poundage since thanksgiving!
dr001225 -- Let's see what YOU got, Oogie! - A watch?? Why in the world would a cat need a watch?? - Oops! The watch is NORMAN'S gift! I must have switched the tags by mistake! - Bad news, Norman...the catnip mouse isn't yours!
dr001226 -- The BUSINESS section?? - You don't even have a JOB! Why on earth would you be reading the BUSINESS section?? - Norman reading the business section is like...like... - Like you reading the health & fitness section! Yeah, like me reading
dr001226 -- the...HEY!!
dr001227 -- I'll have a cheeseburger, medium fries, and a medium root beer! - Would you like to "super-size" your order for only 50 cents more? OK. - Would you like to "gargantua-size" it for another 50 cents? Sure. - I had to put the fries in the trunk!
dr011228 -- Welcome to Galtburger! May I take your order, please? - Hey, it's me. Oh, hi, Ralph! How ya' doin' ? - Do you want your usual, today? Yeah. - When you suddenly realize you've developed a close relationship with the drive-thru clerk, it's
dr011228 -- probably time to have your cholesterol checked! So, how's the family?
dr011229 -- Hey, Ralph! Hey. - Your usual jumbo chili cheese bacon burger with fries and a shake? - AHHEM!! COFF COFF (wife's in the car!) COUGH COUGH! - Uh, I mean, your usual garden salad and diet cola? So, how's your diet going, Ralph?
dr011230 -- Well, the new millennium begins on Monday! - Again?? - It seems like we started a new millennium just last year! - Time really flies when you get to be my age!
dr011231 -- Oh, this is an outrage! - The home owners association is demanding the immediate removal of my holiday decorations! - It's not even JANUARY FIRST, for cryin' out loud! - What's so bad about leaving Christmas decorations up until new year's
dr011231 -- day?? - Maybe they were talking about your HALLOWEEN decorations!
dr010101 -- Norman, a job just opened up at the mall that I think you'd enjoy! - A job?? Gosh, dad, I don't know...what if I'm underqualified?? - Relax, Norm...You're PERFECT for this job! - It's a total NO-BRAINER! What if he's OVERqualified?
dr010102 -- Believe me, Norm, this job will be PERFECT for you! What kind of job IS it, dad? - Trust me, it's right up your alley! You get paid for doing nothing! - It required no brainpower whatsoever! This job was tailor-made for Norman Drabble! - You
dr010102 -- might even want to make a CAREER out of it! The suspense is killing me!
dr010103 -- Norm, your job is to stand in front of the jewelry store, dresses as a royal guard! - And then what? That's it! All you have to do is stand there! - And then what? That's it! Stand there, stare into space, and don't move a muscle! - And then
dr010103 -- what? What part of "THAT'S IT" don't you understand??
dr010104 -- So this is my new job...I stand here for six hours and don't move a muscle! - I should be able to handle this! - - I have to go to the bathroom!
dr010105 -- Norman, is that you? What are you doing?? - Oh, I get it! You're supposed to be one of those guards who stand perfectly still, no matter what! - - Whatever you do, try not to think about that trail of ants crawling up your leg!
dr010106 -- He's real! No, he's a dummy! - Actually, you're BOTH right! Kick him in the shins and see what happens!
dr010107 -- Boy, there's nothing like being inside a hot, steamy sauna! - Except, of course, for being inside the car when MOM is driving! I'm begging you...PLEASE turn down the heater!! Stop complaining! It's JUST RIGHT in here!
dr010108 -- - - He's pretty good! Fortunately I'm used to people making faces at me!
dr010109 -- ? - Why are you wearing glasses, Norm? - Norm? - Z
dr010110 -- Look, kids! It's one of those royal guards! - He'll stand perfectly still, no matter what you do to him! - You can kick him, poke him, tickle him, and he won't move! - Let's try it! You kids have fun! I'm going to Macy's!
dr010111 -- Well, Norm's first day on the job turned out to be tougher than expected! - TOUGH?? All he had to do was dress up like a royal guard and stand perfectly still all day! - I know, but people kept trying to make him flinch, and some of them got
dr010111 -- a little carried away. - Right, Norm? MmPFF
dr010112 -- What a day at work! My new job was brutal! - Standing perfectly still and staring into space all day is tougher than it looks! - Tell me about it! Also, the hat messes up my hair!
dr010113 -- I can't wait to play with my new football! - It needs air. I'll have to pump it up! - "Inflate to 13 lbs"?? - How on earth am I supposed to throw a 13-pound football?

dr010116 -- Bob, you are a totally useless creature! - I don't know why I haven't fired up the barbecue and made a meal out of you, yet! - I guess I just don't have it in me! - Looks like he has everything else in him!
dr010117 -- I'm home! - Excuse me...my perch is not a coat rack! - What could be more undignified? -
dr010118 -- That does it! I obviously get no respect around here! - I think I'll go return to the wild! - - Daddy, I think it's time to steam-clean your hat!
dr010119 -- - - Daddy's hat just ran away!  Can you blame it? His socks walked off yesterday!
dr010120 -- Don't leave your clothes on the floor, Ralph. Hang them up! OK, OK. - - We either need more closet space, or another exercise bike!

dr010121 -- system like that? Sorry. It's a one-of-a-kind! Dad, can I have the rest of the day off? I'm getting a little hoarse!
dr010122 -- January 22, 2001 - Nothing interesting happened in my life today. - Or yesterday, or the day before, for that matter. - Everyone should keep a journal! Except you.
dr010123 -- - - - Cats love to taunt non-cat people!
dr010124 -- I'm home! - zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom - Oogie craves attention! I crave medical attention.
dr010125 -- OOGIE! GET OFF THE DRAPES! - SPLAT! - Oogie puts the CAT in CATASTROPHE! CRASH!
dr010126 -- Hey, Norm, as long as you're up, get me a root beer! - I'm not up!! Oh, yeah, huh. - - Make it a "Dr. Pepper"!
dr010127 -- I wait at this intersection every day... - It doesn't matter which direction I'm going, I ALWAYS hit the red light! - You'd think I'd have a 50% chance of making a green light, wouldn't you?? - Mind-boggling, isn't it? Everything's
dr010127 -- mind-boggling to me!
dr010128 -- Oogie is certainly an active cat! - I've heard that's a sign of intelligence! - The more playful and active a cat is, the more intelligent it probably is! - That's probably true of all creatures, don't you think? - zzZzz No argument from me!
dr010129 -- You'll have to wait your turn, Mr. Drabble. There are other patients before you! But I'm in pain!! - Too bad! Getting your chest hair caught in a lint roller is not a medical emergency! I knew I should've called 9-1-1!
dr010130 -- 'bye, mom! I'm really late! Where are you going? - Dad just reminded me that it's almost February, and I forgot to migrate south for the winter!! - Norman, BIRDS do that! Oh, yeah, huh! - Nice try!
dr010131 -- flip flip flip flip - flip flip flip flip flip flip - flip flip flip FLIP flip - Televised surgical  procedures have taken all the fun out of channel surfing!
dr010201 -- Hello, newsradio? Traffic tipster Drabble here. I'd like to report a major back-up! - Cars are a stand-still! Tensions are running high! ...my location? - The drive-thru lane at Galtburger! They must have a trainee working the window!
dr010202 -- I'm going jogging, honeybunch! You ARE?? - Yeah, what's wrong with that?? Don't you think I can do it?? - Do you think I'm too old and out of shape?? Of course not, Ralph. - Just make sure you're carrying I.D.!!
dr010203 -- Let's sit here, honeybunch! Here?? - Ralph, we can sit anywhere in the theater we want... - Why do you want to sit all the way back here?? - Because someone left behind practically a whole tub of popcorn!
dr010204 -- I have to go to the bathroom! - Excuse me...sorry...pardon me...oops! Sorry! Coming through...excuse me... Ow! - Why did you crawl over every person in this row to get out?? - You were sitting on the other aisle! It would have been much easier
dr010204 -- for you to go THAT way! Oh yeah, huh! - Excuse me...sorry! Sorry! Coming through,,,pardon me...whoops!
dr010205 -- 'bye, mom! 'bye, Norman! Remember your new motto: "Attack the day"! - How did it go? The day launched a counterattack!
dr010206 -- Hey, what happened, dad? A power outage? Perhaps. - Perhaps??? Why ELSE would it be so dark here?? - Norm, when a comic strip is all black and all you see are the characters' eyeballs, it's a safe bet that the cartoonist is sick with a flu! -
dr010206 -- Really?? It's a trade secret, so keep it under your hat!
dr010207 -- I don't understand, dad...if a comic strip is in total darkness, why does it mean the cartoonist has the flu? Because he's too sick to draw! - Imagine being a cartoonist...you have the flu, and you can barely hold a pen, but you have a family

dr010207 -- for a while!
dr010208 -- Dad, are you suggesting that the reason it's dark in here is because the cartoonist has the flu and he's too sick to draw?? - Norm, all I'm saying is, I'm not buying the "power outage" theory. - Why not? - For one thing, it's only 10:30 in
dr010208 -- the morning!
dr010209 -- Dad, how long are we going to have to sit in the dark? Until the cartoonist gets over the flu, and can draw again! - But that could take a WEEK! I have an idea...let's light a match! - - Whoa, more like TWO weeks! I think someone better call

dr010510 -- $50?? What is it?? - It's a bucket of dried paint with a brush stuck in the middle! - Why would you charge $50 for THIS?? It's a conversation piece! - That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!  See? You're already talking about it!
dr010511 -- Steinbauer! What are YOU doing here?? Treasure hunting, Ralph! - I've never seen a garage sale that didn't have at least ONE thing worth buying! - - ...until now. How about this unique wire sculpture?

dr010515 -- HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA Hic! - Try to cheer up, Ralph. Dang! I laughed so hard, I gave myself the hic *hic* Ups!
dr010516 -- Hey, dad! Mr. Steinbauer is on that antiques appraisal show, with the painting of aunt Ethel! Huh? - I picked this up at a garage sale for only $10! - Mr. Steinbauer, before I tell you the value of this piece, you'd better sit down! - Poor
dr010516 -- Steinbauer! They're obviously going  to tell him he wasted ten bucks! In fact, maybe you should LIE down!
dr010517 -- Mr. Steinbauer, this painting was done by the renowned artist, Salvador Heyman! - This painting that you bought for $10 at a garage sale is worth... - $750,000! - Yahoo! I'm rich! I'm rich!! Gee, dad...if you'd known it was THAT valuable, you
dr010517 -- could've sold it for at least $25!
dr010518 -- $750,000?? But I bought it for only $10 at a garage sale! It's hard to believe the seller was unaware of its value! - Well, he's kind of an imbecile! Really? What's his name? - Ralph Drabble. I'll be sure to go to HIS next garage sale! - Ha
dr010518 -- ha ha ha ha hee hee ha ha! Hoo hoo hoo hoo ha ha hoo hoo! Look at it this way, dad...it's free advertising!
dr010519 -- Steinbauer, I demand the return of the portrait of my beloved aunt Ethel! - Sorry, Ralph. A deal is a deal. I sold it under duress! It was a clear case of insanity! - There are laws against taking advantage of people who are in a decreased
dr010519 -- mental state! - You're out of your mind! AH HA! So you ADMIT it!!
dr010520 -- skattle skattle skattle skattle - skattle skattle skattle - skattle skattle skattle skattle - skattle skattle skattle skattle skattle skattle - JUMP! Sorry, Wally. I wouldn't have asked you to hop up on my lap if I'd known it was gonna be
dr010520 -- that much work! pant pant wheeze wheeze!
dr010521 -- You can't have your painting back, Ralph! A deal is a deal! - Steinbauer, if you don't return my painting, I will seek legal restitution in a court of law! - I will plead my case before the highest legal authority in the land! You mean...
dr010521 -- That's right! - Hey, cool! Dad and Mr. Steinbauer are on the JUDGE JUDY show!
dr010522 -- Mr. Drabble, please tell us why you're suing Mr. Steinbauer. Certainly, judge Judy... - But first, may I say that you are even lovelier in person than on TV! - Furthermore, I think you'd make an excellent addition to the U.S. supreme court! -
dr010522 -- You are not only lovely and smart, you are also... Oh, shut up! Yes, ma'am!
dr010523 -- Your honor, Mr. Steinbauer took advantage of me while I was in a decreased mental state! - In the frenzied confusion of a garage sale, he got me to sell him my favorite painting for only $10. - The fact that it subsequently appraised for
dr010523 -- $750,000 is irrelevant! I only want it back because it is a portrait of my dear and beloved aunt Edna! - Ethel! Whatever!
dr010524 -- I've heard both sides of this case,and I've reached a decision...judgment for the plaintiff! - I object, your honor! This is a miscarriage of justice! - Mr. Drabble, YOU'RE the plaintiff. I am?? - SWEET!!! I hope none of my friends are
dr010524 -- watching this!
dr010525 -- Welcome to the antiques appraisal show, Mr. Drabble! Tell us what you have! - This is a painting by the renowned artist, Salvador Heyman! It was appraised here last week for $750,000! - I just brought it back to see how much its value has
dr010525 -- increased since then! - Mr. Drabble, I think you'd better sit down... Oh, boy! This is gonna be good! I'm in the money...
dr010526 -- Bad news, Mr. Drabble...this painting is not by the great Salvador Heyman, it's by SALVATORRE Heyman, who painted by numbers! WHAT? - Last, week, one of your appraisers said it was worth $750,000! He's no longer with us! - You mean it's
dr010526 -- WORTHLESS??! OH, I wouldn't say that... - The frame is probably worth a buck or two! AAAAAHHH!!
dr010527 -- Happy birthday, honeybunch! Why thank you, Ralph! - Did you keep the receipt? Yeah, why? - I'll need it when I return it. RETURN IT?? - You don't even know what it IS, yet! How do you know you want to return it?? How do you know you're not
dr010527 -- going to LIKE it?? - Did YOU pick it out? Yes. - - Thank you. - Ah...I see you bought my birthday gift at the hardware store! Do you know how hard it is to wrap a 3/8'' variable speed reversing drill?
dr010528 -- swim swim swim splash splash - swim swim splash splash splash - LAND-HO!
dr010529 -- Ralph, I'm glad you're home! - The sink is clogged, the dishwasher is leaking, and the garage door springs need to be replaced. - You also need to fix the ceiling fan and take out the garbage. - Whenever she says "I'm glad you're home," it
dr010529 -- means trouble!
dr010530 -- Hey, Wally! Hop on your ol' dad's lap! - skattle skattle skattle skattle - skattle skattle skattle skattle skattle - To Be Continued... skattle skattle skattle ...Sigh...
dr010531 -- Editor's not: In our last installment, Wally the Wiener Dog was attempting to hop up on Ralph's lap. skattle skattle skattle - In fact, while I have your attention, I'd like to point out that we editors don't get the recognition we deserve.
dr010531 -- skattle skattle skattle - You have no idea how often we save the cartoonists from making complete fools of themselves. skattle skattle skattle - Oh, sure...some of them can draw funny pictures, but very few of them know how to spell. Can we
dr010531 -- get on with business down here?
dr010601 -- Editor's note: You know, it's not easy being a comics editor. Long hours, little thanks. skattle skattle skattle - But without us, certain cartoonists would look like illiterates. skattle skattle skattle skattle ...Sigh... - Watch what
dr010601 -- happens if I don't make any corrections... skattle skattle skattle skattle - scatl scatl scatl scatl scatl Pathetic, isn't it? Som wat's you're pointe?
dr010602 -- Come on, Patrick! Be a hitter! - THUMP! BALL ONE! Good eye, Patrick! - THUMP! BALL TWO! Good eye, Patrick! - BONK! TAKE YOUR BASE! Good helmet, Patrick!
dr010603 -- There there, Ralph... - I'm so sorry! - It's a devastating loss. HONK - AllI can do is offer my heartfelt condolences! - What's wrong with dad? - He left his frozen yogurt punch card in his pocket, and it went through the wash! One more
dr010603 -- punch, and the next one would've been FREE!
dr010604 -- One "Happy Meal" for Penny... Thank you, daddy! - One "Happy Meal" for Patrick... Thanks, dad. - And a burger and fries for Norm. Sniff! - It's a sad day when you realize you're too old for a Happy Meal! Most people realize it BEFORE they get
dr010604 -- their driver's license!
dr010605 -- Here, kitty kitty kitty shuffle shuffle - These papers are very important to me, so whatever you do, please don't... - SLASH! - And you wanted to buy a shredder!
dr010606 -- I can't remember where I put my glasses! You're losing your mind, dad! - Norman, highly intelligent people can misplace their glasses! - What makes you think I'm losing my mind?? - You don't WEAR glasses! Oh, yeah, huh!
dr010607 -- I just realized something... - This thin layer of plastic is the only thing between us and dad's pastrami breath! - I'm getting out! Me too! The thanks I get for blowing up the pool.
dr010608 -- ...here's another thing I've always wondered: why do they have minimum-security prisons? - Shouldn't all prisons be maximum-security? Isn't sending someone to a minimum-security prison like daring them to make a break for it? - Sleep! Z The
dr010608 -- hypnotic effect I have on Norman comes in handy sometimes.
dr010609 -- OW! - My tooth hurts! - Chew on the other side! - It still hurts.
dr010610 -- Come on, Wally! Hop on your ol' dad's lap! - skattle skattle skattle skattle - skattle skattle skattle skattle skattle - skattle skattle skattle skattle skattle skattle - skattle skattle skattle skattle skattle skattle - skattle skattle
dr010610 -- skattle skattle skattle - skattle skattle skattle skattle - skattle skattle HOP! We obviously need to work on your hopping!
dr010611 -- I weigh 250 pounds... - Holding 4 donuts, I STILL weigh 250 pounds. - So if I eat all 4 donuts, I won't gain any weight! - SWEET! I'm glad you're not a dietitian!
dr010612 -- - - - OOF! Isn't it amazing how cats always land on their feet?
dr010613 -- - SQUASH! - - Remember your rule, Ralph...only one donut per day! Gotcha!
dr010614 -- - OOF! - Why does this cat always jump on my stomach?? It's kind of hard to miss!
dr010615 -- There's only one thing messier than the inside of our refrigerator! - The OUTSIDE of our refrigerator!
dr010616 -- Look at the sign on the back of that truck, dad! - "This vehicle stops at all railroad crossings." - Isn't that AMAZING? They can actually build vehicles that stop at all railroad crossings! - Talk about your technological wonders! It's a
dr010616 -- great time to be alive, isn't it, son?
dr010617 -- A new baton! Happy father's day, dad! - It's not just ANY baton... It's the one you asked for! - A "mall cop crowd-pleaser." Sweet! I've always wanted one of these! This is much better than my old baton! - How come? It's longer! - So why is
dr010617 -- that better? - Holds more donuts!
dr010618 -- So long, honeybunch! - I'm going off to work,now! - wiggle wiggle wiggle - Nothing says "I'll miss you, darling" quite as much as a pinky-fingerwave.
dr010619 -- Some men like to live on the edge, Wendy! - Some men look danger into the eye and laugh! We thrive on the adrenaline rush of a disaster narrowly averted. - All I asked was why your shoelace is always untied! I'm trying to explain!
dr010620 -- Food Court Pardon me, Ma'am... - I regret to inform you that your friend just swiped one of your french fries while you weren't looking. - Score another victory for the security cam.
dr010621 -- The following is a test of the emergency broadcast system. - This is only a test: - AAAAHHH! WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!!! - Thank you.
dr010622 -- Norman! Why are you ringing my doorbell at this hour?? - Well, it's summer vacation so we don't see each other every day, and I didn't want you to forget me! - You know the old expression: "out of sight, out of mind." - You're out of mind,
dr010622 -- all right!
dr010623 -- This is the most poorly run fast food place I've ever seen! The lines are ridiculous! - I bought YOUR lunch, but I didn't buy any for me! I refuse to spend a penny more than I HAVE to! - Sometimes I feel it's necessary to take a stand! - Mind
dr010623 -- if I have some of your fries? I hate it when dad takes a stand.
dr010624 -- - - OOF! - Isn't it interesting how cats always seem to gravitate to the person who wants them the least? "Gravitate" is a good word.
dr010625 -- Hello. I'm Norman Drabble. - - Hello. I'm Norman Drabble. - Sweet! I never knew I was ambidextrous!
dr010626 -- Son, before you walk out that door, I want to say something... - It's a dangerous and confusing world out there. There are choices to be made, consequences to be paid. - As you leave this house, hold your head high and be firm in your
dr010626 -- convictions! - What are YOU doing back?? I just went out to get the paper!
dr010627 -- Hey, there's the crocodile hunter!! - This guy's great! Every day he comes face to face with the meanest and nastiest creatures on earth! - Big deal. bite scratch snarl claw!
dr010628 -- Did we get a new table? No, it's actually several cases of soda pop! - I had to disguise it to look like furniture because we ran out of room in the pantry. - That's one of the drawbacks of membership at bulk club. - Careful...you're sitting
dr010628 -- on a year's supply of macaroni and cheese!
dr010629 -- How come you never see a fat ant? - You'd think with all the sugar they eat, some of them would have weight issues! - It must be all the walking they do! - What do YOU think? I think I'm ready for summer vacation to be over!
dr010630 -- Aw, mom...do I have to eat this stuff? - You most certainly do! Why? - Ralph, tell Patrick why it's important to eat this! Uhh... - Well, you never know when you might want to be a contestant on "Survivor".
dr010701 -- Ralph, I'm glad you're home! Tell me what you think of our new bedspread. - I love it. - You haven't even SEEN it yet! I just bought it this afternoon! - Go upstairs, look at it, and THEN tell me what you think! - - - - I love it. -
dr010701 -- ...Sigh...why do I even bother to ask your opinion? - That's what *I* always wonder!
dr010702 -- Fourth Of July Fair Oh, boy!! - - Now there's a man who loves cotton candy! Sweet!
dr010703 -- - HA! MISSED AGAIN! - Dunk Steinbauer Give someone else a chance, Ralph! Norm, go find the nearest ATM!
dr010704 -- Close your eyes and hold still! - TSSSHH - That's the stupidest face-painting booth I've ever seen! What do you want for a quarter? The Mona Lisa??
dr010705 -- What if Kathy doesn't like the baby gift I bought for her sister-in-law? ...Sigh... - Honeybunch, you can't worry about EVERYTHING! - Who says? - Oh, yeah...I momentarily forgot who I was dealing with! Just because YOU'RE a lightweight...
dr010706 -- Ralph, why do you watch the same baseball highlights over and over on the sports channel? - For those who understand, no explanation is necessary. For those who don't understand, no explanation is possible. - ...Sigh... - Also, the batteries
dr010706 -- in my clicker are dead!
dr010707 -- Help me unload the car, Ralph! Unload the car?? - I thought you were just going to the cleaners! - I was, but a great parking space opened up right in front of the market, and I couldn't pass it up! - I 'm glad it  didn't open up in front of
dr010707 -- a jewelry store!
dr010708 -- HUSTLE, PATRICK, HUSTLE!! RUN TO THE BALL!! GET YOUR HEAD IN THE GAME!! LET'S GO!! DON'T JUST STAND THERE!! RUN!! BIG KICK!! ATTACK THE BALL!! - OH, COME ON, REF! GIVE US A BREAK!! Gee, I never realized I was so vocal! Maybe we shouldn't take
dr010708 -- the camcorder to any more of Patrick's soccer games. - Maybe we shouldn't take MOM to any more of Patrick's soccer games!
dr010709 -- Norman, wait... - - Just as I thought...Wendy really like me! Just as I thought...if you hold Norman's head to your ear, you can hear the ocean!
dr010710 -- I think we should go on the roller coaster before the line gets long. I think we should go on the train! Or the submarines! - I want to see the characters! Maybe we should have brunch! Let's do the raft ride! We usually spend the first hour
dr010710 -- at the amusement park trying what to do first.
dr010711 -- Hey! There's no line for the log ride! SWEET! - Unsweet.
dr010712 -- Sodas 4.00 - Lemonade 4.00 - Water 4.00 - I love theme parks! The theme of this park is "we gotcha!"
dr010713 -- WOOOOOOO! - AAAAAHH!! - Dad's idea of a thrill ride is the parking lot tram. Is it over yet??
dr010714 -- I'm so upset! - According to the scale, I'm two pounds heavier than I was last week! - That's not so bad, honeybunch! - I'm two pounds heavier than I was when I woke up!
dr010715 -- Ralph, why are you vacuuming? - Why shouldn't I vacuum? It's my house, too! - I contributed to this dirty floor as much as anyone! The least I can do is vacuum it once in a while! - I'm vacuuming because I don't think you should have to do it
dr010715 -- all the time! - - And also because I recently discovered the cat is scared of it! WHIRRRRRRRRR!
dr010716 -- Having insomnia is the loneliest feeling in the world. - Everyone is asleep except me. - What did I ever do to deserve this? - Besides refilling my coke cup  nine times at Burgerland!
dr010717 -- Insomnia is a cruel thing. - I want to go to sleep, but I can't! - Few things are worse than being awake in the middle of the night all by yourself. - And here's one of them. What a coincidence! I can't sleep, either!
dr010718 -- Dad, the key to overcoming insomnia is to relax. - Reading can be relaxing. Here, look at a book! OK. - SPROING! YAAH!! - Why would you give me a POP-UP BOOK?? It's one of my favorites!
dr010719 -- I know how to beat insomnia...let's watch TV! TV always makes me sleepy! - We'll find something relaxing. Let's see...the shopping channel, the weather channel... flip flip flip flip - - Never turn on the surgery channel when you're trying to
dr010719 -- relax! So, THAT'S what a gall bladder looks like!
dr010720 -- Here's something interesting...a televangelist is exorcising the devil out of some lady. - Now, how do you suppose she got to the TV studio? - Is it really a good idea to let a possessed person get behind the wheel of a car? - Maybe somebody
dr010720 -- drove her. That must be like trying to drive a cat to the vet!
dr010721 -- Hey, it's the antiques roadshow! I love this program! - Hm...that appears to be a Baltimore Silver Moneith bowl from the late 1700's, worth about $10,000. - What we have here is a Baltimore Silver Moneith bowl from the late 1700's, valued at
dr010721 -- $10,000! - You're amazing! Thank goodness for reruns!
dr010722 -- Bank - Gas - - - - - OK, this is getting ridiculous!
dr010723 -- Sweet! "Leave It To Beaver" is on! I didn't know it was on this time of night! - This is the episode where Beaver gets on the wrong bus! - More popcorn, Norm? - I never knew insomnia could be so much fun! Say, I wonder if there's any ice cream
dr010723 -- in the freezer?
dr010724 -- Z - Hey, dad! Wake up!! huh? - I finally fell asleep!! Why did you wake me up??!! - I didn't want to be the only one in the house awake! Thanks alot.
dr010725 -- FWAP! Oh, boy! What was that? - The morning newspaper landing on our driveway! Let's go get it! - You shouldn't go outside looking like that! - Don't worry. Nothing moves faster than a man getting the paper in his PJ's! You shouldn't even be
dr010725 -- INSIDE looking like that!
dr010726 -- SLAM! - Norman, please tell me you didn't close the front door! - I didn't close the front door! - Good, because if you did, we'd be locked outside in our underwear! It sort of just closed by itself!
dr010727 -- I can't believe we're locked out of the house at 4:00 A.M. - What time do you say it was? Four A.M. - It seems like four A.M. is an important time, for some reason, but I can't remember what! - Oh, yeah...that's when I programmed the
dr010727 -- automatic sprinklers to come on!
dr010728 -- What are you two doing out here?? - Ada and I both had insomnia last night, mom. We accidentally locked ourselves outside in our pajamas... - And the the automatic sprinklers came on and got us soaking wet. - AGAIN?? This has happened to you
dr010728 -- before?? It hasn't been a good month!
dr010729 -- - - CHOP chop CHOP chop CHOP - Sweet! I always wondered what would happen if I reversed the direction of the ceiling fan! Turn it off before I lose any more hair!
dr010730 -- Hi, Wendy! It's Norman! - I just called to tell you that I'm now a TV star! I'll be on network television tonight at 8:00! - ...the program? It's called "Caught On Tape: The World's Stupidest Human Beings". - I'm the guy with the weed
dr010730 -- whacker! Are you sure you want to publicize this?
dr010731 -- The video store? - I thought we're going out to the movie theater tonight! We were, but then I figured... - Why would I want to go to a theater with sticky floors, uncomfortable chairs and noisy kids... - when I have all that at home?
dr010801 -- Video - - - 10,000 titles, and nothing I want to watch.
dr010802 -- The video store Musicals Horror Action Classics Comedy Drama - The video store if Ralph Drabble ran things  Car Chases  The Duke  Monster Movies  Movies With Pie Fights  Stooges  Guy Movies  Movies With Monkeys In Them
dr010803 -- When are the movies due back? It depends. - Really popular videos are due back in two days. - Less popular videos are due back in five days. - When is "The Revenge Of Ol' Yeller" due back? April.
dr010804 -- One of the great mysteries in life is how video stores stay in business. - They rent movies for only a buck, they have stores on every block... - And there's never anybody in... - here. Until six P.M. Saturday night!
dr010805 -- Shoes Running Walking Court Basketball Hiking Running Basketball Athletic Walking Skate Skate Cross Training Running Athletic Court Channel Surfing Now we're talking!
dr010806 -- Yak yak yak! . What did you say?? - Yak! - Thank goodness for Animal Planet!
dr010807 -- We have a camp fire and a bag of marshmallows... - Now all we need are coat hangers. - Found some! -
dr010808 -- How's this? - Keep trying. - ...Sigh... You're the only man I know who's so cheap, he makes his kids re-bend coat hangers after they roast marshmallows. I call it "The Gift Of Thrift".
dr010809 -- I've noticed that baseball bloopers aren't as funny as they used to be! - I mean, look at that...a guy fell down. That qualifies as a blooper?? What's so funny about that?? - The problem is, we've experienced a proliferation of bloopers over
dr010809 -- the years, and now there aren't enough ones to go around! - You've given this way too much thought, dad. I'm telling you, our society has been overblooped!
dr010810 -- Look, dad! The wave is coming around the stadium! - Big deal. I hate the wave. No baseball purist would be caught dead doing the wave! -WOOOOO!! - Unless you need to adjust your shorts!
dr010811 -- Hey, Norm, check if my breath is bad. - HAAAAAAHH It's fine! - Hey, Patrick, check to see if there's anything in my nose! - All clear! And I thought I had a bad job!
dr010812 -- Here you are, sir! One large peanut butter and chocolate with cookie dough! - What's all this? - What? This! In between the yogurt and the inside of the cup! - I don't see anything! EXACTLY! - There's a whole lotta empty space in here! - Now,
dr010812 -- show me some love and top it off a little! - That was only moderately embarrassing. The squeaky wheel gets the yogurt!
dr010813 -- What are you doing? Putting up DONUT DAY decorations! - "Donut Day"?? It's a new holiday I invented! - Donut day is when we honor and celebrate the donut by hanging out in donut shops! - What makes you think it will catch on? I'm counting on
dr010813 -- the support of law enforcement.
dr010814 -- August is the only month without a holiday, so I invented DONUT DAY! - The idea is sweeping the nation! The NATION?? - Well, maybe not the entire nation...but it's sweeping the state! - OK, the Cul-de-Sac! I'd be happy if it swept the porch!
dr010815 -- Son, I've been named GRAND MARSHALL of the TOURNAMENT OF DONUTS parade! - Grand marshall?? It's an honor bestowed upon the person who ate the most donuts during the past year! - YOU ate the most donuts?? No, actually it was another guy... -
dr010815 -- But he can't make it because he's having bypass surgery!
dr010816 -- You're going to be GRAND MARSHALL of the tournament of DONUTS parade?? - What's the tournament of donuts parade?? It's the highlight of DONUT DAY! - Every float in the parade is made entirely from donuts! - Yuk! I'll be on the float right
dr010816 -- behind the artery cloggers dance ensemble!
dr010817 -- OK, let's go over our donut day activities... - After the tournament of donuts parade, there's a donut eating contest... - Then we'll do some donut tasting, and finally bobbing for donuts! - Let the fethh-tivities begin! I hope he doesn't
dr010817 -- drool all day!
dr010818 -- For you, my love! - Happy donut day! Why, Ralph! - I don't know what to say! - It's a necklace made of donut holes! I just thought of something to say: eww!
dr010819 -- HERE COMES THE PLUNGE! HANG ON!! - HERE WE GO!! - - Next time, I think dad should sit in the front! Could you lean forward a little bit, please?
dr010820 -- Well, dad, so far I'd say DONUT DAY has been a big success! - Everyone has enjoyed the contests, festivities, and the tournament of donuts parade! - I agree, son. I think there's only one word that can adequately sum up donut day... - SWEET!
dr010820 -- There's one other word: ANTS!
dr010821 -- Hello? Um! Fumph mmph thmf! I beg your pardon? - Mmphh um pmff thhpff! I'm sorry, but I can't understand a word you're saying! - Hi, mom! Dad was just trying to tell you that he won the "How many donut holes can you stuff in your mouth"
dr010821 -- contest! - My hero.
dr010822 -- Ooooohh! What's wrong? I ate 3 dozen donuts, but I still lost the donut-eating contest! - Ralph, your doctor has been warning you for years about the dangers of overindulgence! - What would he say if he knew you entered a donut-eating
dr010822 -- contest? He was the winner!
dr010823 -- Whoa! I'm stuffer, but it's a good kind of stuffed! - Why can't every day be donut day? - Actually, with you, dad, every day IS donut day! Oh, yeah, huh!
dr010824 -- Well, dad, I think donut day was a big success. You raised donut awareness throughout the country! - Not to mention his cholesterol level! ...dad? Can you hear me? It's interesting how his eyes look like little donuts!
dr010825 -- - - skreech! skid! slip! slide! spin! - It's a good thing cats have no sense of embarrassment! CRASH
dr010826 -- - ? - Who in the world are THESE people?? - I've never seen these kids before in my life! - Why is there a picture of strange children on my refrigerator?? - Those are your cousin Bonnie's kids, and their picture has been hanging on our
dr010826 -- refrigerator for at least two years! - You're so observant! I have a cousin Bonnie?
dr010827 -- - - How come when I jump in an elevator that's going down, my head doesn't hit the ceiling? - Nobody ever says "good question, Norman."
dr010828 -- phhoot! - I need more lotion! - You're the only one I know who can use up an entire tube of sunscreen in one application! I must be losing weight! I got it all the way down to my kneecaps!
dr010829 -- Whoa! - Never eat a half gallon of cookie dough ice cream immediately before baking in the hot sun! "Baking" is the right word.
dr010830 -- BEEP BEEP! Whoa, I gotta go! - Want anything, honeybunch? No thanks. - Good morning, Mr. Drabble. 'morning, James! I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing that the donut shop sends a limo for your dad every morning.
dr010831 -- - - Look at me! I'm a duck! - No offense, Bob. I think I'll migrate.
dr010901 -- - WHOOOP - Haaahh! sssssssssssssssss - WHOOOOP - Interesting way of deflating the pool! It's my breath and I want it back! sssss
dr010902 -- Lackluster Video I'm looking for a movie that doesn't contain any nudity, graphic violence or bad language. Sorry, that one's checked out!
dr010903 -- BELLY FLOP! - SPLOOSH! - That was quite a flop! It was quite a belly!
dr010904 -- FORE!! - FOOOFFE!!! - FORE! - Ready to go play golf, dad? Yeah, I think I'm all warmed up!
dr010905 -- tokkl okkl - Let's see...that hole was a par three, and you took a nine! - What would you call that? It's not a double-bogey, it's not a triple-bogey... - I like to call it a "PAR²".
dr010906 -- Golf can be an expensive sport. - I can understand looking for a lost ball... - My dad's so cheap, he looks for lost tees! Rats! I wonder if I can glue this back together?
dr010907 -- thwak - crack! - - tokkl okkl - Suh-SWEET!! That was the ugliest hole-in-one I've ever seen!
dr010908 -- A hole-in-one!! Congratulations, dad!! I have achieved golf immortality! - Your whole life changes when you make a hole-in-one, Norm! - yeah, for one thing, you automatically get nicknamed "Ace". - Can you imagine mom calling you "ace" from
dr010908 -- now on? I was just getting used to "Grunt head"!
dr010909 -- - - puff puff - WHEEZE! - AARRGHH! - PANT PANT WHEEZE WHEEZE PUFF PUFF You look like a scene out of ROCKY TEN!
dr010910 -- Describe your hole-in-one, Mr. Drabble. - Well, I was challenging 152-yard par 3! - Taking the wind conditions into account, I used my 7-iron to hit a shot with just enough backspin to land five feet beyond the cup and roll back in! - Don't
dr010910 -- forget the part where it bounced off a condominium! Shoosh!
dr010911 -- Ralph, Golden Irons Country Club would like to congratulate you on your great accomplishment! - Aw, it was nothing Tiger Woods couldn't have done! - My tee shot landed on the green and took three bounces into the cup for a hole-in-one! - I
dr010911 -- was actually disappointed because I intended it to take only TWO bounces!
dr010912 -- Ralph, Golden Irons Country Club would like to present you with this trophy for your hole-in-one! - This is the greatest moment of my life!! clap clap clapclap clap - And now, Ralph, it's customary for the hole-in-one golfer to buy drinks for
dr010912 -- everyone! - Say what? So much for the greatest moment of his life!
dr010913 -- In keeping with golf tradition, Ralph will now buy drinks for... - Wait a minute!! My hole-in-one might not count! It was kind of a cheapie! - For one thing, it was only 152 yards! - So? Actually, it was even less than that because he hit
dr010913 -- from the ladies' tee! Yeah, so that's cheating, right?
dr010914 -- Ralph, it's customary for the golfer who makes a hole-in-one to buy drinks for everyone! - Sir, I cannot take credit for that hole-in-one. I had too many clubs in my bag, which, I believe, is a two-stroke penalty! - I have too much respect
dr010914 -- for the integrity of this great game to... Oh, nonsense! - DRINKS ARE ON RALPH! When I count three, we're going to make a run for it!
dr010915 -- All right, all right...to celebrate my hole-in-one, I'll treat everyone to drinks! - Follow me! - NEXT!
dr010916 -- You're up, dad! I know... - I hate teeing off in front of a crowd. It makes me nervous. - Oh, well...here goes... - WHACK! - AW NUTS! WHAT A TERRIBLE DRIVE!! - THAT WAS WAY BELOW MY STANDARDS!! - What are you talking about, dad? That was
dr010916 -- beautiful! It was probably the best tee shot you've ever had! - I know that, and you know that but none of THESE GUYS know that!
dr010917 -- Norman, what time do you have? - 6:42. Let me rephrase the question... - What time is it? - Noon. Thank you.
dr010918 -- Hello? ...oh, hi, Connie! Connie?!! - Yeah, she's right heeee...I mean... - She's NOT right here! She's...uh...she's...umpiring a baseball game! - UMPIRNG A BASEBALL GAME?? Hey, if you want me to screen your calls better, go to MIME school!
dr010919 -- Remember, the future is now! - That's not true! How can the future be NOW?? The future isn't NOW, the future is... - - - NOW!!
dr010920 -- What in the world...who's been tampering with my radio buttons? - Me. I tuned them to classical music. Why?? - I thought it would have a soothing effect on your disposition! But I like the oldies station! - So think of this as the
dr010920 -- SUPER-oldies station!
dr010921 -- - boop boop beep boop - whirrrrr! - ATM donut machines: an idea whose time has come!
dr010922 -- Don't feel bad, Norm... - I nicked my face a few times the first time I shaved, too! - Maybe he should've used an electric razor. - He did!
dr010923 -- Hello? ...oh, hi, Kathy! - Yeah...uh huh... - ...oh, really? - gallop gallop gallop BANG BANG Is that right? - BANG BANG crash! Hold on a minute, Kathy... - BOOM Turn down the TV! Can't you see that I'm on the phone?? - Now, where was I? IN
dr010923 -- THERE!!
dr010924 -- SHOVE! - Penny! Why did you push your brother?! - He pushed me first! He did? When? - Last February!
dr010925 -- - Why are you squinting, Ralph? - I just noticed that if I squint, you don't look half bad! - Why are you squinting, dad? I got socked in the eye.
dr010926 -- - AAAAAAHHHH!! - Somebody call 9-1-1! I told you Norman wasn't ready for double-sided tape!
dr010927 -- - - GRRRRRRR! - It's an unwritten law that any loose fries belong to dad. Well, write it before someone loses a hand!!
dr010928 -- Hey, Norman! - Are you here today? - Yes, I'm here. Oh. - You're such a nothing, sometimes it's hard to tell. Thanks for asking!
dr010929 -- brush brush style style - SIGH... - Gee, honeybunch, you look beautiful this morning! - That's known as a PRE-EMPTIVE COMPLIMENT!
dr010930 -- - Pardon me... - WHACK! - Tell me again why you thought it would be nice to live near a golf course. Mind if I take some mints?
dr011001 -- Wendy, I want you to be honest... OK! - You have a weak chin, you dress like a child, and you run like a goose. - Your eyes are too close together, and you sound like a girl when you sneeze. - This is fun! Actually, I just wanted to know
dr011001 -- which book cover you thought was the coolest.

dr020205 -- Are you an author? Yes, I'm... Of course he's an author! - Why else would he be sitting here like an idiot next to a pile of books? - If you were smart, you'd ask him to sign a book for you! It might be valuable some day! - Fine! See if we
dr020205 -- care! But if he croaks in the near future, you're gonna kick yourself!
dr020206 -- Yawn - - What are you staring at?! He's just trying to make a living! Beat it! No looky-looking! - Is it my imagination, or do you have more books now than when you started?

dr020217 -- aunt Nadine again, and looking through photo albums for another half hour. - I used to hop right up when she said it's time to go, but I've gotten wiser over the years. - I said let's go! Relax. That's the 20-minute warning, Patrick. Go get
dr020217 -- me another root beer!
dr020218 -- Have I ever mentioned how much I hate ducks? Bob isn't a duck, dad... - He's a rare south American parrot that takes on the characteristics of a duck for survival in the jungle. - If he's really a parrot, then we should be able to teach him
dr020218 -- to talk! - Repeat after me: "Here kitty kitty kitty!"
dr020219 -- If that bird isn't a duck, how come he likes the water? - I told you, dad! Bob is a rare south American parrot that takes on the characteristics of a duck for survival in the jungle! - What makes him think he lives in a JUNGLE?? - He's seen
dr020219 -- our back yard! And, from a distance, you sort of look like a gorilla!
dr020220 -- Are you SURE he isn't a duck?? Absolutely! - Don't worry! We know how much you hate ducks! - I don't really hate ducks! I actually kind of like 'em! You do?? - Especially with sweet and sour sauce!
dr020221 -- Dad's getting wise to us, Norman! He's beginning to suspect that Bob isn't really a rare south American parrot! - What are we going to do?? I think I have an idea... - - - Nope, I was wrong.
dr020222 -- I wonder if they're just TELLING me you're a rare south American parrot because they know I hate ducks? - If I ever find out you're NOT a rare south American parrot, keep two words in mind: - Duck McNuggets - OK, he must be a parrot. I've
dr020222 -- never seen a duck sweat!
dr020223 -- Dad, I learned something today that's useful to know. - What? - You know how the dashboard light comes on when you're low on gas? Uh-huh. - I dos covered that when it comes on, you still have exactly 38 6/10 miles to go before it actually runs

dr020224 -- Wow! Can I have this picture? Can we make extra prints of this one? Can I hang this in my room? Gee, I look good! Can I give this one to Wendy?
dr020225 -- - I've come to realize that I'm nothing without you. - I've got news for you, Norman... - You're nothing WITH me, either! Oh, yeah, huh!
dr020226 -- Here, Ralph. I just washed your St. Patrick's Day shirt. Hang it up, please. - My St. Patrick's Day shirt? I'm a little behind on the laundry, OK??
dr020227 -- May I help you? I'd like to return this book. - Is there something wrong with it? All the pages are blank! - I'm not picky, but when I buy a book, I at least expect it to have some words inside! - Too bad...the title "Daily Journal" sounded
dr020227 -- so intriguing!
dr020228 -- Sorry I haven't fixed the sink yet! I'm behind schedule! - Even Ralph Drabble is entitled to run a little behind once in a while! - That's the first time I've ever heard "Ralph Drabble" and "little behind" in the same sentence!

dr020327 -- So you need a letter of recommendation, eh, Troy? Let's see what we can do... - "I can honestly say that I have known and admired Troy for the past ten years." - Don't write that, Mr. Drabble! Why not? - I'm only eight years old! OK, I'll
dr020327 -- leave out the "honestly".
dr020328 -- "I heartily recommend Troy for the office of student body president. - "Troy will rid our school of corruption, increase teachers' salaries, and reduce class size." - How in the world can I reduce class size?? - You could be absent now and

dr020403 -- Speed limit?? Uhhh... - I'm hoping it's about 70 or 80!
dr020404 -- You were going 62 in a 45 MILE PER HOUR zone. - Were you in a hurry? Why, no, sir! - I was just on my way to donate blood and ten to do volunteer work at my local church! - I thought you were going to the liquor store to buy lottery tickets!
dr020404 -- Shush!
dr020405 -- Officer, I can explain this whole thing. Please don't, Norm. - The reason my dad wasn't looking at the speedometer is because we were playing "Slug Bug". "Slug Bug??" - Every time you see a bug car on the road, you slug your opponent and say
dr020405 -- "Slug Bug" before he slugs you! ...Sigh... - It gets a little distracting. In fact, we almost rear-ended a cement mixer! Don't come visit me in jail, OK, Norm?
dr020406 -- You were playing "Slug Bug" while you were driving?? It's addictive! My son taught me this dumb game, and now I can't stop playing it! - Every time I see a... - SLUG BUG! - Please tell me I didn't just strike a police officer! I think he's a

dr020408 -- You know what my idea of fun is? - Driving around the parking lot of the mall playing "Slug Bug". - Yeah..."Slug Bug" is sweet! - One good thing about being you, Norman, is that you'll never be a victim of identity theft. I also like to spin

dr020531 -- flip flip flip YIKES!! TURN THAT OFF!! - I can't bear to watch those closeup surgical procedures!! - This isn't the surgery channel, it's the cooking channel! - They're just stuffing a turkey. I wondered why the doctor looked like Emeril!
dr020531 -- Bam!
dr020601 -- I'm back from the video store! - Did you rent "Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein"?? - No, I rented "Sense and Sensibility" - I hate it when mom goes to the video store! I'll watch SENSE but not SENSIBILITY.
dr020602 -- ...and the Gilligan said to the professor... - NORMAN, RUN! - Nah-ahh! You just want me to run away and leave you alone! - I'm finally wise to that little game, and I won't fall for it anymore! - Whenever I start to bore you, you shout "run"
dr020602 -- so I'll panic and flee! - Do you really think that I'm stupid enough to fall for the same trick over and over and over and... - - A delayed reaction is better than nothing.
dr020603 -- Hello, you sweet kitty! - Mommy loves you! - Why is it that you seem to like that cat more than you like me?? - For one thing, the cat cat doesn't shed as much!
dr020604 -- This golf ball is the property of Ralph Drabble. - If found, please call 555.6771. - You don't have a lot of confidence in your tee shots these days, do you, dad? Maybe I should include my area code!
dr020605 -- Hey, there's my ball! - I thought you sliced it way out into the woods! Nope! That is definitely my ball! - It should be easy to tell. You always write your name on it! - This ball says "Bob". Who are you going to believe, me or a ball?
dr020606 -- Lounging on the couch, watching TV! - How could you be lazier?? I can't find the remote... - Will you feel around underneath me and see if I'm lying on it? I had to ask.
dr020607 -- You need to put your dog on a leash, Steinbauer! - It's rude to let him run all over the neighborhood! - You never put YOUR dog on a leash! - Wally doesn't need a leash! skattle skattle skattle skattle
dr020608 -- Honeybunch, I'm starving! - I've eaten nothing all day! NOTHING?? - Nothing except for a Granola bar... - ...and a double chili cheeseburger! For you, that's nothing.
dr020609 -- We're off the zoo! - Whoops, I forgot my keys! - Oh, there they are! - Hey, where's my wallet? - Whoa! Why did I come back in here? - Oh, yeah, I forgot my wallet! - No, it's in my pocket! - Did I lock the door? Wha ton earth is he doing? I
dr020609 -- call it the "midlife mambo".
dr020610 -- Excuse me, sir. Are you officer Dabble? - Uh-huh. Mall cop first class Chambers reporting for duty, sir! - A new recruit! Welcome aboard, rookie! - Don't worry, I'll whip you into shape in no time! Here, have a corn dog!
dr020611 -- Excuse me, officer...can you tell me where the restroom is? - Certainly, ma'am. It's halfway down the corridor, second door on your left. Thank you. - No no no, Chambers...that's not the way a seasoned mall cop answers a question like that!
dr020611 -- - The correct response is: "What do I look like, a directory?" Repeat after me...
dr020612 -- Chambers the key to being a successful mall cop is FOCUS! - Never lose your focus, because... - Care to sample our teriyaki chicken? Don't mind if I do! - What was I talking about? I forget.
dr020613 -- Chambers, from 2:00 to 3:00, we're on escalator duty. Escalator duty? - We ride the escalators up and down to make sure everything is OK! - What could be lazier than standing on an escalator for an hour? - Oh.
dr020614 -- Chambers, the food court vendors like to have mall cops around. They like the sense of security! - Watch and I'll show you a little trick of the trade... - WELL, I THINK WE'LL MOSEY ON OVER TO MACY'S NOW! - You boys care for some pizza? How
dr020614 -- about some ice cream? Sweet, isn't it?
dr020615 -- It's been a rewarding week, No-Neck... - I took a raw recruit and shaped him into a real mall cop. - Isn't that right, Chambers? *urp*
dr020616 -- I can't wait to try out my new driver! - The "BIG BUBBA"! It's guaranteed to ad ten to twenty yards on your tee shot! - Watch this... - WHOP! - Wow, dad! I can really see the difference! - Instead of just hitting it out-of-bounds like you
dr020616 -- usually do, you hit it over the fence and into the parking lot!
dr020617 -- Son, don't feel bad because a girl turned you down for a date. Most girls would love to go out with a smart, handsome boy like you! - Well, maybe "smart" and "handsome" aren't the right words... - But I'll bet there are lots of girls who
dr020617 -- would love to go out with a guy like you! - Well, maybe not "lots" Don't always fell like you need to be there for me, dad!
dr020618 -- Norman! Don't chew with your mouth open! - That's not the proper way to eat! - Give Norman a break, daddy! - He hasn't had as much EATING EXPERIENCE as you! Who has?
dr020619 -- Hello, Mr. Drabble...and I wanted you both to...Saturday after...because I think...anyway and I also... It never fails. - without...clari...do no...love...base...febr...swing...golf...why not Someone leaves a long phone message, asks you to
dr020619 -- call back... - And then, at the very end, when they finally leave their number... - call me back at 362-mumble mumble mumble. They mumble, forcing you to listen to the entire message again! boop!
dr020620 -- What the... - Poink! YEEOWCH!! - The next time I have a giant hair growing out of my eyebrow, feel free to tell me! We were kind of curious how long it would get before you noticed.
dr060221 -- Boys, you've been watching TV all afternoon! - Here are a couple of books... - If you hear your mom come home, turn off the TV and act like you're reading 'em! - Keeping your kids out of trouble is part of a father's duty!
dr060222 -- Poor Bob! He always has that dazed and confused look on his face. - Like he doesn't know who he is or what to do next! - Kind of like dad on a Saturday! ...and then, after you fix the garbage disposal, the trees need trimming. After that you
dr060222 -- need to paint the patio furniture and clean out the garage...
dr060223 -- Hi, Ralph! - - How are you? - - You wouldn't be eating something on the new sofa, would you? Especially after I warned you never to do that! - RALPH DRABBLE, OPEN YOUR MOUTH THIS INSTANT!! - Nothing! - You are SO not funny! I just like to
dr060223 -- freak her out sometimes!
dr020624 -- Hey, what was that?? Wait, I saw Tiger Woods! Slow down! I think I saw an elephant swimming! Whoa, a baseball game! Wait!! - Let this be a lesson to you, son. Never relinquish control of the TV remote! This is known as "payback", Ralph! flip
dr020624 -- flip flip flip
dr020625 -- SLPOOSH! - - - Next time you do a cannonball, dad, tell us so we can close the windows!
dr020626 -- Three balls, two strikes...two outs in the ninth...here's the pitch... *crack!* A high fly ball to deep center! - OH, WHAT A CATCH!! Not only are you annoying, you're annoying at the worst possible time!
dr020627 -- Aren't you going to play golf today, dad? My golfing days are over. - I think it's best to retire before I start to make a fool of myself! - Actually, dad, it's probably a little late for that. Oh, yeah, huh. - OK, never mind!
dr020628 -- I'm not sure which ball is mine! - Norm, you should put distinctive markings on your ball. - That way, you'll always know which one is yours! - Is that why your balls all have stripes around them and say "range"? Uh...yeah, that's it!
dr020629 -- - - - Phone I know how you feel.
dr020630 -- - KNOCK KNOCK - -UH...JUST A MINUTE, PLEASE! - OK! - *creak!* - - Out of respect for the community, I always knock before I go outside in my underwear!
dr020701 -- - - Crazy Mirrors Come on, dad, put your shirt back on and let's go on the coaster!
dr020702 -- If you like baseball, you're RELISHING this game! - The sox trailed early, but MUSTERED four runs to CATCH UP! growl! - What is it about baseball that makes me crave hot dogs? It's a BUNT!
dr020703 -- When I was 8 years old, there was a cool skateboard that I really, really wanted... - But you said no, because it looked too dangerous. I was really mad and you said, "trust me, son, one day you'll thank me." - Remember that, dad? Yes. -
dr020703 -- Well, I just wanted you to know that I'm still kind of steamed about it. Thanks for the update, son!
dr020704 -- A picnic in the park, a ball game on the radio, and fireworks in the sky! - It's a great tradition, isn't it? It sure beats fireworks on the radio!
dr020705 -- I don't mean to constantly criticize you, Norman... - But I do it for your your own good! - Just think of me as the wind beneath your wings! - I guess that explains why I often like the cow in "Twister".
dr020706 -- Sometimes I wonder if I'd still be attracted to you if you liked me better. - I guess that's one thing we'll never ever know, will we? I wish you were a little more inquisitive!
dr020707 -- Norman, what are you doing? - Buying some books, dad! Why are you buying ten copies of the same book? - Because each copy is marked 20% OFF! So? - If each copy is 20% off, that means five copies will be 100% off! Therefore, the first five
dr020707 -- books are free! - Six books would be 120% off, which means the store now owes ME 20%! Get it? - So, if I buy ten books, not only are all the books free, but the store will owe ME 100%! - I'M GONNA BE RICH!! It's hard to believe that boy
dr020707 -- flunked algebra!
dr020708 -- Hey, dad! I'm going to pull an ALL-NIGHTER tonight! Huh?? - I'm going to stay up all night long and watch TV! Why do you want to do that? - Why go to bed? There's no school in the morning and I have no job to go to! - How many opportunities
dr020708 -- like this will I ever have?? Quite a few, I'm willing to bet!
dr020709 -- Are you sure you want to stay awake all night, Norm? Absolutely! - I'm going to stay up and watch TV and do fun stuff! - But rest assured that while everyone else is fast asleep, I'll be standing guard over our home! - Now *I* won't sleep!
dr020710 -- *Yawn* I never knew staying up all night would be so difficult! - My eyelids are heavy. Fatigue is setting in... - But I've come too far to give up now! What time is it, anyway? - 9:15 Maybe I'll go splash cold water on my face!
dr020711 -- Hey, dad, would you like to stay up all night with me? - Norm, need I to remind you that ONE of us has to get up early in the morning? - What do you mean? Tomorrow's your day off! - Yeah, but I still have to get to the donut shop by seven, or
dr020711 -- all the Long Johns get picked over!
dr020712 -- Part of the fun of staying up all night is watching scary movies! - They always seem scarier in the middle of the night! - YIKES!! - When Mary Poppins slides up th staircase, it always freaks me out!
dr020713 -- It's the middle of the night,and I'm going to do something wild and crazy: T.P. the neighbor's house! - On second thought, the neighbor's might not like that! I know, I'll T.P. my OWN house! - On second thought, it's pretty dark and scary
dr020713 -- outside! - Tell me again why you toilet-papered our kitchen. I'm a wild and crazy guy!
dr020714 -- OK, Norm, I want you to back up the car very slowly. - Slow and steady! Keep it coming! - Just a little bit more... - OK! Thanks! There's no such thing as an empty tube of toothpaste!
dr020715 -- Dad, you parked in a loading zone! - Is that appropriate? - Believe me, when your dad goes to the all-you-can-eat buffet, it's appropriate! Where's the pizza?
dr020716 -- Hello, newsradio? Traffic-tipster Drabble, here... - The harbor freeway is at a standstill, thanks to a jack-knifed big-rig! scribble scribble - Here you go! Thank you! - And would you please tell your listeners to quit bugging me for
dr020716 -- autographs! Hey, it's tipster Drabble!
dr020717 -- How was the movie, dad? - It must have been pretty good! I only left to go to the bathroom once! - I judge how good a movie was by how many times I had to go to the bathroom. - That's an interesting rating system, dad! A "one-flusher" is
dr020717 -- first rate!
dr020718 -- Tipster Drabble reports that traffic is light on the evening commute! - MRS. Drabble reports that she is very angry because tipster Drabble left gum in his shirt pocket again, and it went through the wash! - We advise tipser Drabble to take an
dr020718 -- alternate route home...preferably a longer one, that will allow your wife to cool off! - Those traffic reports give you a lot of information!
dr020719 -- Ralph, I can't believe you left gum in your shirt pocket again! - It went through the wash, and now the shirt is ruined! - How could you be so stupid?! I'M stupid?? - YOU'RE the one who married me!
dr020720 -- Ready, begin! - wiggle wiggle wiggle - wiggle wiggle wiggle - ...and rest! That's the dumbest exercise program I've ever seen!
dr020721 -- Looks like you're in the lake again, dad! - ...Sigh... - All right. Hold my hat, please! - - Dad, I know golf is a frustrating game... - But you really should quit throwing your clubs! Found 'em! Now let's go look for my ball!
dr020722 -- Smile, Ralph! - Hey, don't point that thing at me!! - Why not? Because the camera adds ten pounds! - That's not as much as the bacon cheeseburgers add!
dr020723 -- Say, Wendy, would you like to go out with me on Friday? - There is absolutely, positively no chance on earth of that happening! - No way. No how. Case closed. - So, would Thursday work better?
dr020724 -- Wendy, would you like to go out with me on Saturday? - Nope. Forget it. Absolutely not. - No chance. That's a negative. Sorry. - I envy guys who get mixed signals!
dr020725 -- Now hold still... What's wrong? - Norman's swimmer ear! - He's lying on his side so I can put drops in! drip! - I hope it doesn't leak out the other ear and get on the sofa!
dr020726 -- Norman, why are you lying on the couch? - I'm in discomfort. - I have swimmer's ear, athlete's foot, and tennis elbow! - And to think I flunked P.E. in high school!
dr020727 -- I drink one of these diet shakes for breakfast, one for lunch... - And then have a sensible dinner, just like the directions say! - So why am I not losing weight? - Maybe it's the box of donuts you eat for brunch! They don't mention brunch,
dr020727 -- so I have to improvise!
dr020728 -- putt! - - tokkl okkl! - I GOT A BIRDIE!! - STOMP - ...or not! Now I know why golfers need to stay in shape!
dr020729 -- There's nothing like being at a baseball game, Wendy! - Except being at a football game. That's kind of being at a baseball game because there's a lot of grass and people and stuff. - Come to think of it, a lot of things are like being at a
dr020729 -- baseball game. - So disregard everything I said! No problem there!
dr020730 -- Norman, is something on your mind tonight? - Well, yes, actually. How could I tell? - Have I been acting peculiar? No. - That was my first clue!
dr020731 -- Wendy, where are you going?? The snack bar. Excuse me... - You can't leave now!! Something interesting is liable to appear on the giant message board any minute now!! - What on earth are you...oh my gosh. - Wendy, will you marry me? Norman
dr020801 -- Well, Rex, a wonderful thing has just happened here at ballpark! That's right, Steve! - A young man named Norman has proposed to his beloved Wendy on the stadium jumbotron! - How romantic to propose marriage in front of 56,000 fans! - Love is
dr020801 -- in the air, eh, Wendy? It will be when I toss you out of the upper deck!
dr020802 -- Hey, that looks like Norman at the baseball game! It is, dad! - Did he catch a foul ball? No, he just proposed Wendy on the stadium jumbotron! - 56,000 fans are anxiously awaiting her reply! Come on, Wendy! Give Norman a big smooch! - Ouch!
dr020802 -- That didn't look like a smooch! That's gonna leave a mark! Let's see the replay on that!
dr020803 -- SLAM! I'm home from the ball game! For future reference, son... - Never propose a girl on the stadium jumbotron unless you're reasonably certain she'll say yes. Hindsight is 50/50.
dr020804 -- I'll take this one and that one! Yes, sir! - - What?? - Don't look at me like that! - Aw, heck! Give me all the rest of 'em, too! - I have a soft heart! I wish we could say the same about your arteries!
dr020805 -- You know, Norman, I've never thought of you as handsome... - But sometimes, if the light is just right... - And I squint and make my eyes all blurry... - On second thought, never mind! Wow! That's as close to a compliment as I've ever gotten!
dr020806 -- I'm back from the golf course, honeybunch! What was your score? - 107. Yipes! - Hey, it wasn't as bad as it sounds! - with a few breaks here and there, I could've easily shot 104!
dr020807 -- Wendy, would you like to go miniature golfing with me tomorrow tonight? - I'm sorry, Norman, but I already made plans to floss my dog's teeth! - Actually, that isn't true. - I'm not sorry!
dr020808 -- Wow! I'm impressed! - Hey, you must be important! - Apparently, it's now a symbol of prestige NOT to have a cell phone! Show off!
dr020809 -- Wendy, how would you like to go to the movies tonight? Sorry, I'm busy. - Next time you ask me out, it would be more polite to give me a little advance notice! - How would you like to go to the movies a week from Saturday? I'm still busy. -
dr020809 -- How would you like to see "Star Wars-Episode III" in 2005? I only said it would be more polite, not more effective.
dr020810 -- WHACK! - FORE!! - CRASH! - I hollered "fore!" It's not my fault if that condominium didn't get out of the way!
dr020811 -- Rock! Scissors! - A rock pounds scissors! I win! - - Rock! Paper! - I win! A rock pounds paper! - Scissors! Rock! - Scissors are more expensive than rocks! I win! - A TIE! I win! Boy, she's really good at this game!
dr020812 -- Before I decide which classes to sign up for, I always examine the professor's office door. - If the door is neat and empty, it indicates the professor is organized and means business. - If the door is cluttered, it means the professor is
dr020812 -- probably easy-going and gives better grades. - Who says I haven't learned anything at college?
dr020813 -- For the attack to be successful, the element of surprise is important! - I am clearly outnumbered. - Ten to tone! wiggle wiggle wiggle
dr020814 -- Well, hello, you stupid cat! What do YOU want? - Have you come to hiss at me? Claw my pants leg? Attack my fingers? - What is it you want?? - purrrrrr OK, now I know she's up to something!
dr020815 -- What's going on? purrrr . For no reason at all, Oogie jumped up in my lap and started purring! - That's amazing. What? That she's suddenly being nice? - No, that sh could find your lap!
dr020816 -- - ...Sigh... - CLICK! - It's very hard to fall asleep with a cat in the room!
dr020817 -- You stupid cat! How do you expect me to fall asleep with your eyes glowing in the dark? - Hey, I have an idea! Where's my nightstand? Aha! - Rats. - Sunglasses help a little, but not enough!
dr020818 -- RING! - Hello? ...oh, hi, No-Neck! - ...my TV? Yeah, it's on... - You want me to turn on the baseball game? - OK, now what? ...look WHERE?? - Oh, yeah! I see you! - Some people shouldn't have cell phones!
dr020819 -- "Cat Questions Answered" By Ralph Drabble - Q: Why do cats rub up against your leg? A: Because they're stupid. - Q: Why do cats purr? A: Because they're stupid. - Go ahead, try to stump me!
dr020820 -- Oogie has gone from one extreme to the other! - She used to attack me all the time. Now she just sits in my lap and purrs! How annoying! - You just don't appreciate cats! I do SO appreciate cats! - I think they make excellent tennis rackets!
dr020821 -- Ralph, I made an appointment for you to take Oogie to a cat psychologist! Purr! - A CAT PSYCHOLOGIST?? He'll be able to tell you why Oogie has been acting strangely. - I already know why Oogie has been acting strangely... - Because she has a
dr020821 -- brain the size of a macadamia nut! You're just jealous!
dr020822 -- I can't believe I'm talking to a cat psychologist. - It's a growing profession! Few people understand their pet cats! - In order to understand pet cats, one must THINK like a cat! - Excuse me...I have an itch! Looks like we've come to the
dr020822 -- right place!
dr020823 -- What did the cat psychologist say? Purrr! - He said cats gravitate to the person who pays them the least attention. Oogie has been nice to me because I've been ignoring her. - He said if I want Oogie to act like her old self, I should pay
dr020823 -- more attention to her. Did he say anything else? - No, then he sat on the window sill and took a nap!
dr020824 -- According to the cat psychologist, the way to make Oogie act like her old self is to pay more attention to her! OK. Purrr! - Hello, you sweet little... - SLASH! She's back! Yipes!
dr020825 -- - - - - OOF! - 10 9.5
dr020826 -- I don't know why you guys always hang around when I eat. - It's not like I'm going to share. - See? All gone! - munch munch munch crunch We get fat just off his crumbs!
dr020827 -- The first day of school can be intimidating. It's easy to get lost! - Excuse me...I'm looking for my history class. - Can you direct me to the social studies building, room 313? That would probably be at the college across the street. - This
dr020827 -- is a hospital. At least I'm in the neighborhood!
dr020828 -- Norman, I knew we'd be in the same English class this year, so I saved you a seat! - You saved me a seat? Thanks, Wendy! That means you really DO like me! - Then again, maybe not. Pip down back there!
dr020829 -- School has started again... - And I already feel like the weight of the world is on my shoulders! - But then I realize... - It's just my backpack!
dr020830 -- Gasp! - Kids, with the start of a new school year, let's review our carpool etiquette... - Rule number one: when the weather turns cold and we can no longer roll down the windows... - No one will be allowed to eat onions for breakfast!
dr020831 -- And now for a newsradio traffic update... - Tipster Drabble just called in to alert us to trouble developing during his school carpool commute... - Apparently, if Travis doesn't stop kicking the back of tipster Drabble's seat, there's liable
dr020831 -- to be an accident on Oak street! - Sorry. Don't make me call them again!
dr020901 -- - - - Whoa! - - - - Few things are stronger than the gravitational pull of a donut shop! Especially when you're on a diet, huh, dad!
dr020902 -- Hang on, big fella! Everything's gonna' be all right! - I've got wet towels to keep you cool! - As soon as the crane gets here, we'll try to get you back in the water! pat pat pat What luck to run into Steinbauer at the beach!
dr020903 -- I think you should tell your wife how you feel. Thanks for the advice, doctor! - But now let me get to the reason I've come to see you...I have an ingrown toenail, see, and... - I'm not a PODIATRIST, Mr. Drabble...I'm a PSYCHOLOGIST! You
dr020903 -- are? - I wish the phone book used a larger print! You may also need an optometrist!
dr020904 -- - Oof! - Just walking into a home improvement store causes my back to go out!
dr020905 -- WAAA! What's wrong, Penny? - Daddy told me Scooby-Doo died! - Ralph, why would you tell Penny that Scooby-Doo died? - I told her I once scuba-dived! Did somebody say Scooby-Doo died??
dr020906 -- I can't believe it's already September! - My summer tan is already gone! - I wish MINE was! I told you to take off those stupid sunglasses!
dr020907 -- - Thanks, Norm! - I always knew you'd come in handy! - putt! Norman Drabble: human ball marker.
dr020908 -- - - - - - - - We should spend the day together more often, dad! I have an idea: let's get another donut!
dr020909 -- Morning, Steinbauer, how's my favorite neighbor? - What are you asking ME for, Ralph? Because you're my favorite neighbor! - That's one of the things I admire about you-your sense of modesty! - Aren't you the same guy who called police
dr020909 -- because my wind chime was too loud? - Ha ha ha! That's another thing I admire about you, Steinbauer! You have a fantastic memory!
dr020910 -- Good morning, Steinbauer! I brought you some fresh cinnamon rolls! - What's going on, Ralph? If I didn't know better, I'd think you were trying to kiss-up me! - Me?? Kiss up??? HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA - Steinbauer, I can
dr020910 -- honestly say that you have the quickest wit in America!
dr020911 -- Ralph, does your sudden neighborliness have anything to do with the sign in my front yard? Sing?? - Another Pool By Polecat Pools Are you trying to weasel an invitation to swim in my new pool? - Gee, I didn't realize that! - Then why did you
dr020911 -- come here in fins? They provide excellent arch support!
dr020912 -- I see your new pool's all finished, Steinbauer! - Wow! It's got everything! Waterfall, hot tub, slide...I'll bet it's going to be great for entertaining! - If I had a pool like that, the first thing I'd want to do is invite the neighbors over
dr020912 -- to enjoy it with me! - Subtle as a train wreck, Ralph! Did I mention I got a snorkel for Christmas?
dr010913 -- Boy, this is the life, Ralph! - Too bad you've been  such a creep over the years, or I'd invite you in for a dip! - Creep???! Who's the guy who picked up your newspaper every day when you were on vacation? You. - You also pick up my newspaper
dr010913 -- every day when I'm NOT on vacation! Yeah, but I usually put most of it back!
dr010914 -- You shouldn't stare into Mr. Steinbauer's back yard, dad. It's not polite! I don't care. - I'm going to start at his new pool until he invites me over to go swimming. - Eventually, my sad and forlorn look will make him feel guilty! SPLOOSH! -
dr010914 -- I don't think it's working. Nice cannonball!
dr010915 -- That'll be one dollar. All I have is a $20 bill. - - - - KA-CHING! - Nineteen dollars is your change. - ...17, 18, 19. What's the matter? Don't you trust me?
dr020916 -- No-Neck! Why are you in Steinbauer's new pool? - He invited a bunch of people over to go swimming today! - He said he invited practically everyone in town! - How come YOU'RE not over here, Ralph? I'm the "practically".
dr020917 -- Hello, police? This is Ralph Drabble. I'd like to report a public nuisance! - My neighbor, George Steinbauer, is having a wild pool party. It's well after six P.M. and I'm sure there must be a curfew in effect? - No?? Well maybe I should
dr020917 -- speak to the chief! ...he's what? ...OK, never mind. - The chief is at Steinbauer's pool party!
dr020918 -- MARCO! POLO! - Did somebody call me? - Buzz off, Ralph! We're trying to play "Marco Polo". Oh. - From a distance, it sounded like "Come over and go swimming, Ralph!" I need a taller fence!
dr020919 -- Steinbauer, if you don't want to invite me to go swimming in your new pool, that's fine with me! - Who needs your pool? I've got my own pool, and it's just as wet as yours! - Right, guys? Actually, dad, I don't think there's any water left in
dr020919 -- here!
dr020920 -- I can't believe Steinbauer would build a new pool and not invite me swimming! - Then, to add insult to injury, he throws a big pool party and invites everyone except me and my family! - If it makes you feel any better, dad, YOU'RE the only
dr020920 -- one he didn't invite! Thanks for the clarification, son.
dr020921 -- Steinbauer, what do YOU want? - I want to invite you to go swimming in my new pool! - I've been feeling ashamed. I'm sorry I didn't invite you sooner! sniff! - I'm sorry too, Steinbauer! What are YOU sorry about? - I snuck into your yard last
dr020921 -- night and stocked your new pool with trout! YOU WHAT??
dr020922 -- Mmm-boy! - Mind if I cut myself a slice of cake, honeybunch? - Better make it a SMALL slice! Remember, you're on a diet! - What constitutes a "small" slice? No more than one inch thick! - - -
dr020923 -- YES!!! - I can't believe it!! This is the greatest day of my life!! - They're building a "Krunchy Kakes" donut shop two blocks from my home!! I haven't seen dad this excited since he saw Jim Rome at the mall!
dr020924 -- I've got my tent, sleeping bag, lantern, canteen... - So long, honeybunch! See you in about a month! - Their first customer wins free donuts for life!
dr020925 -- Dad, I know you're excited about the new "Krunchy Kakes" donut shop, but why are you camping out?? Because their first customer will receive free donuts for life! - But, it's going to be a long time before this place is finished! Can you
dr020925 -- afford to take this much time off work? - I've dome the math...the money I'll save on lifetime donuts will more than compensate for my lost wages!
dr020926 -- Hi, dad! How's the camp-out going? It's exciting! - When these "Krunchy Kakes" opens its doors, I'll be their first customer and win free donuts for life!! - By the way, ho's everything at home? Mom says it's not the same around the house
dr020926 -- without you. - So she put the philodendron in your easy chair and said that's pretty close! I'm glad she still has that wonderful sense of humor.
dr020927 -- Well, Norm, the grand opening is at hand! - I'll be their first customer, and thereby win free donuts for the rest of my life! - There will undoubtedly be media coverage, so I should go freshen up! - Hold my place in line, Norm! You can count
dr020927 -- on me, dad! 'scuse me.
dr020928 -- What the... Dad, I have some bad news and some good news... - The bad news is, I inadvertently stepped out of line and lost your place... - So you won't be receiving a lifetime supply of free donuts! - But here's the good news: As the 513th
dr020928 -- customer, you are entitled to one free donut hole!
dr020929 -- Z - - - - I wonder what Oogie dreams about? I don't know, but I bet it's stupid!

dr020930 -- ping I SHOULD NEVER LEAVE THE HOUSE, SHOULD I??
dr021001 -- $1000 fine for littering - Dad, I just saw a sign that said "1,000 Fine For Littering". So? - It seems to me that $1,000 would be fine for a lot of things, but littering isn't one of them! - Besides, why would anyone throw that much money out
dr021001 -- the window? Sometimes I feel like that's what I'm doing with your college tuition!
dr021002 -- - PRESENT DAY - Daddy, what does that say? "Present Day". - Does that mean it's supposed to be Christmas?
dr021003 -- Wow! - Daddy, I just saw a commercial for something amazing! What's that, Penny? - A toothpaste that promises to give you WIDER TEETH! - I'm afraid wider teeth would make my head hurt! You've been hanging around Norman too long!

dr021007 -- !!!!! - !!!! - !!!!!! -
dr021008 -- I never set foot in a doctor's office until I was 35 years old. - By the time I was 40, I was going to the doctor's office once a year. - And now that I'm over 45... - RALPH!
dr021009 -- - Help! - Over you go! FLIP! - Thanks! I'm always glad to help a victim of "backpack rollover".
dr021010 -- I'm going out tonight, dad! Just remember one thing, son... - - Yes, sir! - A father's glare is worth a hundred admonitions!
dr021011 -- Patrick, do we have a leaf blower? Yeah, it's in the garage. - Did dad ask you to do some yard work? Nope... - He asked me to clean out the inside of the car! whirrrrrr!
dr021012 -- A leaf blower?? What a dumb way to clean out the car! - How else could I get rid of all those food crumbs? Do what I do... - Put Wally in there for a few minutes!

dr021014 -- Men - You know that sign in the rest room that says "Employees must wash hands"? Yes. - Does that mean you don't have to wash your hand's if you're not an employee? No. - OK, I'll be right back! I may not be here.
dr021015 -- SCAT, YOU FILTHY WATERFOWL!! flap flap flap - Keep your stupid duck out of my pool , Ralph! - Bob isn't a duck, Steinbauer! He's a rare south America parrot that takes on the characteristics of a duck for survival in the jungle! - You're out

dr021016 -- squeeeze! - SCARF scarf SCARF scarf - Rats! The ice cream topping is supposed to harden into a chocolate shell, but it never works! - That's because you have to GIVE it a few seconds, dad! Did you inhale your spoon again, dear?
dr021017 -- scarf scarf scarf scarf - The way dad eats ice cream, I'm surprised he never gets a headache! He eats it so fast, his head never knows what hit it! That was good, I think!
dr021018 -- I still don't understand it...how can dad eat ice cream so fast and never get "brain freeze"? scarf scarf scarf  - Probably the same reason he never gets "hat hair! Whoa! I think mom just called you bald and stupid! She's on a roll!
dr021019 -- Hey, this looks good... - The Cajun rib-eye steak, marinated for 36 hours in Cajun herbs and spices! - That's what I want! Very good, sir! - It will be ready next Tuesday!

dr021023 -- I can't believe how heavy my backpack is! It must weigh fifty pounds! - I'm going to put it on the scale and find out! - Only TWO POUNDS?? Dad's scale is not known for its accuracy. Are you insinuating that my correct weight is not 175
dr021023 -- pounds?
dr021024 -- Holy cow! No wonder your backpack is so heavy! - Look at the size of this textbook! - My history book wasn't this big when I was a kid! - There wasn't as much history when you were a kid!
dr021025 -- Let's pick out a big one! Yeah, a REALLY big one! As big as dad's head! - As big as his STOMACH! Well, let's not get carried away. - Yeah, a pumpkin that size would be way too expensive!
dr021026 -- This movie isn't scary. - Of COURSE it's scary! It's "THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON"! This movie scared me to death when I was a kid! - What's so scary about it? LOOK AT HIM! HE'S A FISH GUY!! - *yawn* It's hard to frighten kids who've

dr021031 -- Thank you, Mr. Drabble! You're welcome! - I thought Mr. Drabble wasn't giving away treats because he ate them all! That's true. - Then how did you get all that candy and stuff? He's letting us rummage between his sofa cushions and keep
dr021031 -- whatever we find! Next kid, come on in!
dr021101 -- Here's half of our Halloween candy, dad! - We figured we'd just give it to you now to save you the shame and embarrassment of swiping it while we're asleep! - You kids sure know how to take the fun out of things!
dr021102 -- Nothing is quite as sad as seeing a jack-o'-lantern on the front porch two days after Halloween! - Except, perhaps, seeing Christmas lights on our house 312 days after Christmas! I know, I know...that's next on my "to do" list!

dr021106 -- butterball!
dr021107 -- It's nice to see you sharing your food with Bob, dad! - I'm trying to fatten up this duck for thanksgiving! - Bob's not a duck, dad. He's a rare south American parrot that takes on the characteristics of a duck for survival in the jungle! Oh,

dr021112 -- - Look out the window at that breathtaking view, honeybunch! - -
dr021113 -- ...turn right on Washington Street, in 2.74 miles. - Proceed 0.21 miles, and turn left on Oak. Then right on Elm, in 0.65 miles. - Continue for 1.37 miles and turn right into the parking lot! Thanks very much! - Enjoy! If you need directions
dr021113 -- to a donut shop, dad'sa human "Mapquest".
dr021114 -- - Yes! - I'm done with my homework! - Watching the cable listings scroll down the TV screen for 20 minutes does not fulfill your required reading assignment!

dr021116 -- Arrrrrggh! - Hurry up, dad! I can't hold your feet much longer!! Grunt! Groan! - Maybe you should just go inside the bank next time! Naw, these drive-thru ATM's are much more convenient!

dr021120 -- So, you want me to teach you everything I know, eh, son? - OK, here goes... - Uhhh...let's see... - Never ever touch this blue button on the TV clickers, 'cause it just messes up everything! Slow down! I'm taking notes!
dr021121 -- Whichever line you're standing in in always moves the slowest. - It's hard to find anything good on TV between 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM. - The loose french fries down at the bottom of the sack always taste the best! - Dad, when I asked you to
dr021121 -- teach me everything you know, this isn't exactly what I had in mind. Relax. I'm just warming up!
dr021122 -- ...and finally, son, never buy a green suit! - - That's IT?? I asked you to tell me everything you know, and THAT'S IT?? - No wonder I'm such a goofball! It's hereditary! did I tell you the one about the french fries at the bottom of the bag?

dr021203 -- Are you sure you want to go outside in those sweats, Ralph? - Why not? Sweatpants are for active men who have self confidence. - These sweatpants make a fashion statement! - Yeah, "I don't own a full-length mirror". Wisenheimer!
dr021204 -- - - Sweet! - The great thing about sweatpants is you can leave 'em wadded-up on the floor all night and still wear 'em the next day!
dr021205 -- Someone forgot to put the adhesive lint roller away! - SKKKRAAKKK! - SKRAAAKK! SKRAAKK! - I refuse to ask.
dr021206 -- I love my new sweatpants! - Wearing sweatpants has changed my life! - I may be sorry I asked this, Ralph, but how has wearing sweatpants changed your life? - For one thing, not a single person today has had to tell me my zipper's down!
dr021207 -- - pick pick claw claw - BOO! - Let that be a lesson to you! And he thinks the CAT is psycho!
dr021208 -- plug! - - ? - - - - Steinbauer, what made you think you could get away with plugging your Christmas lights into MY OUTLET?? I've gotten away with it every other year!

dr030119 -- - - - - - I take it you misplaced the TV clicker again! I'm gonna have to put this puppy on a leash!
dr030120 -- Your mom and I are going out to dinner, kids! - They must be going someplace fancy. How come? - Dad's wearing his black sweat pants!
dr030121 -- A puddle of water! - SPLAT! - Hey, that wasn't any fun! - It's a PILE OF LEAVES that's fun to jump into. Oh, yeah, huh!
dr030122 -- Darn! - It's January, and I still have that Canadian Christmas song stuck in my mind! - What Canadian Christmas song? You know, the one that goes... - "Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh eh?"
dr030123 -- - Wow! Dad caught a jellybean in his mouth! - I never miss! - How exactly did you get a jellybean stuck up your nose, Mr. Drabble?
dr030124 -- I brought home something from school, dad. - "Dear parent..." - "Our academic advisers recently met with your son and daughter..." . So far, it sounds like you made quite an impression!
dr030125 -- Sniff! - Is that a TEAR I see? Are you actually CRYING, Ralph?? - You always tease ME about getting emotional at movies, but you're just as bad as I am! - Actually, I'm only crying because I just yanked a hair out of my nose.
dr030126 -- WHIRRRRR! - BZZZT! - Sweet! - There's nothing better than putting on warm sweat pants on a cold day! - I guess there's nothing wrong with putting your pants in the dryer to warm them up... - But I'm not sure you should do it in the
dr030126 -- Laundromat! TAMORDNUAL
dr030127 -- MALL You wanted to see me, commander? Yes, Drabble... - I have some bad news and some good news... - The bad news is, the mall is downsizing, and you're being laid off. - What's the GOOD news?? I shot a hole-in-one over the weekend!
dr030128 -- Penny, daddy has been laid off from work. - Do you know what that means? - I think it means we're going to have to sell our house and our car, and I won't be able to attend college. - Yeah, that's about it. My dream of having a big wedding is
dr030128 -- probably shot, too, huh!
dr030129 -- Don't worry, dad. You'll find another job! - You don't understand. No one wants to hire a man my age. How old are you? - 46. Wow! - Uh...I mean, that's not old! Maybe not for a lobster!
dr030130 -- I'm afraid no one will ever hire me again because I'm too old. - Dad, rest assured you are not too old! - Rest assured you are still youthful! Rest assured you are still "with it." - People your age need plenty of rest!
dr030131 -- Although you've been laid off, Ralph, our situation is not dire. - I've been working on an emergency food-storage program. You'll be relieved to know we have a year's worth of food stored in our garage. - I know, I found it. - Don't tell me...
dr030131 -- Fortunately, I've only eaten 11 months' worth.
dr030201 -- Don't be depressed, Ralph! You'll find another job in no time! - Why would want an old, out-of-shape guy like me? - Don't think of yourself that way, dad! Hold your head up high! - It makes your turkey neck not so obvious!
dr030202 -- Frozen Yogurt Open - - - - - - DING! - To ensure prompt service, always carry your own bell! May I help you?
dr030203 -- Mom, I'm worried... - I hope we won't have to relocate! don't worry, Norman. - Since your father lost his job, he seems to have taken root!
dr030204 -- I hope dad finds another job soon! Me too. - When a man finds himself suddenly out of work with nothing to do, it can take an emotional toll! - Yeah, and it's probably kind of hard o dad, too! Those dishes would get cleaner if you scrubbed
dr030204 -- them counter-clockwise!
dr030205 -- Would you like me to taste anything, honeybunch? - I wish you wouldn't hang damp laundry in the doorways. - You missed a spot! Whirrrr! - What's so great about "Dr. Phil"? For one thing, he goes away to work every morning!
dr030206 -- I didn't think it was possible... - But I have found one thing worse than having my husband follow me around the house all day long: - Having him follow me around the grocery store! You know, it would be a much a better strategy to start on
dr030206 -- THAT aisle and work our way to the front!
dr030207 -- Spinach?? Don't buy spinach!! - These tomatoes are fresher! - You shouldn't buy things just because you have coupons! - Rat poison? Why are you looking at rat poison? We don't have rats!
dr030208 -- My guidance counselor says we should choose a career that allows us to be ourselves! - I'd like a job where I can wear sweat pants and look like a slob. - How about a cartoonist? A cartoonist? - I don't know how to draw! See? You're already
dr030208 -- qualified!
dr030209 -- Crud. So much for the parallel-parking lesson!

dr030210 -- like you! Shhh! Can't you see that I'm on the phone?? - Sorry, Dr. Flora! See what I mean?
dr030211 -- Ralph, since you've been out of work, all you've done is sit around and drink soda! - It may LOOK like that's all I'm doing, but I'm actually working to make money! - All these cans are going to the recycler! KLANK!
dr030212 -- I'm back from Bulk Club! you sure got there a lot! - That's because I need to get away by myself. I'm not used to having you home all day. - Therefore, I spend a lot of time at bulk club! - Unfortunately, time's not ALL you spend there! Go
dr030212 -- bring in that 25-pound bag of pinto beans.
dr030213 -- 'bye, Ralph! I'm going shopping at Bulk Club. Again?? - Why do you go to Bulk Club every day? I need to get away during the day. This house isn't big enough for the both of us! - If you keep shopping at Bulk Club, this house won't be big
dr030213 -- enough for EITHER of us!
dr030214 -- Welcome to Bulk Club! Ralph!?? - What are YOU doing here?? I got a job, honeybunch! - I work at your favorite store! How lucky is that? Now you'll REALLY be seeing me a lot during the day! - I think I'm going to cry. Hey, I need to see your

dr030223 -- 'FORE!! - SPLAT! - Excuse me, folks! - What do you think, Norm...should I use a sand wedge or a lob wedge to hit out of a bowl of oatmeal? "Let's buy a cone on the golf course", you said! "It will be fun", you said!

dr030226 -- Sweet! there are parking places right up front! - Those are 20-minute spaces, dad! We'll be in the store a lot longer than that! No problem! - If I take up three 20-minute spaces, that gives us an hour!
dr030227 -- - - - - - Darn! I still can't tell the difference between the cat opener and the salad shooter! whirr!
dr030228 -- * - I'm so stupid! - - Aren't you going to ask WHY? Some things are pretty self-explanatory.

dr030309 -- Ralph, we're in a BUFFET! You can make more than one trip to the ice cream machine! Yeah, but people always stare at you when you go back for seconds!
dr030310 -- How in the world do you make this pen work? - You twist it! Oh, yeah, huh! - Oops! - Do we have any correction fluid? Norm, are you sure you want to fill out that application to join "Mensa"?
dr030311 -- Norman, is your homework done? Sort of. - "Sort of"? It's mostly done. - "Mostly done"? Pretty done. - I'll go get started on it! Thank you.

dr030504 -- I'm home early, honeybunch! - Honeybunch? - la la la la Oh no! She's doing housework with the headphones on again! - If I tap her on the shoulder, I'll startle her and she'll get mad at me! - But if I turn around and go back outside, the

dr030530 -- CRUNCH - It's fun to squash soda cans with your foot! - - OW! OW! OWW!! You're supposed to open it and drink it first.
dr030531 -- My Father by Patrick Drabble - My father was born here in this town. - Start over. - My dear old dad was born right here in this cotton-pickin' town. - How's your 500-word essay coming, Patrick? It's getting there!

dr030603 -- - - Don't you even *DARE* think about eating that pie!!!! - Even her sticky notes yell at me!
dr030604 -- Rats! The cord still doesn't reach. - I guess we'll have to buy another extension cord! Another extension cord?? - I thought our extension cord was 75 feet! - It is, when you can get it untangled!
dr030605 -- Dad, will you quiz me on my spelling words? Sure, Patrick! - "Porridge" - "Porridge"?? Why is "Porridge" one of your spelling words?? - It's the 21st century! Why would you ever need to know how to spell "Porridge"?? Remind me not to ask him
dr030606 -- to help with algebra.Psss! Wendy! How old is the earth? - Five billion years old. - Really? I thought it was only 4.5 billion! - Time flies!
dr030607 -- HONK Bless you. - "Bless you"?? I figure we say "bless you" for a sneeze... - Why shouldn't we say "bless you", when somebody blows their nose? It's kind of similar! - That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. You're welcome!
dr030608 -- How come you like to barbecue, dad? - It's a guy thing, Norm. Men love to barbecue! - The desire to cook raw meat over an open fire is inborn in all men! - It dates back to primitive times when hunters would return to the village, and proudly
dr030608 -- roast their prey to feed their family! - Now explain channel surfing. - It has something to do with the brave sentinel standing watch over the village, Wisenheimer!
dr030609 -- - I admire how some people can eat and read at the same time! - What's so hard about that? - I guess I just don't have a talent for it!
dr030610 -- We filled the pool for you, dad! Thanks, boys! - SPLOOSH! - To conserve water, we should probably fill the pool AFTER dad gets in!
dr030611 -- Hey, knock it off, you dumb cat! - You have a nice, new scratching post, but you never use it! - What's up with that?? - The scratch post is the kitty equivalent of the exercise bike!
dr030612 -- Pull forward to the third window, please. - Is this the third window? No! Keep going! - - Something tells me I went too far!
dr030613 -- Ralph, as a courtesy to the other movie-goers, remember to turn off your cell phone. - BOOP! - ...and one more thing... I know. I'm putting it on. - I tend to doze off!
dr030614 -- Bagels - - YECCHH! - Nothing is worse than an unexpected piece of onion in your chocolate bagel!
dr030615 -- OK, Ralph, here's our itinerary for the day... - After church, we'll all take a family nature hike! - Then we'll go to the lake for a picnic! - After that, well come home and sing a few songs around the piano! - Then you can fire up the
dr030615 -- barbecue and cook shish kabob! - And after that, we'll go over to my mother's house to watch her vacation videos! - Won't that be fun? - Try to look excited, dad! I've come to the realization that father's day is just mother's day part two!
dr030616 -- ha ha ho ho hee hee! cackle cackle - HOHO Ha HA cackle cackle cackle HA HA ho ho ho ho hee hee ha ha ha hoo hoo - NOTHING IS THAT FUNNY AT SIX A.M.! - Don't yell at the morning drive-time DJs, Ralph! Somebody needs to!
dr030617 -- Dad? - I'm right here, Norm! - I'm trying to get the fire just right to barbecue some burgers! - did you need something, Norm? I just wanted to let you know all of our smoke alarms work!
dr030618 -- Dad? I'm right here, Norm! - Here are the burgers! Thanks! The fire's just right! I'll put 'em on! - SPLAT! - You missed. Sorry. That one's mine!
dr030619 -- - - - The hot dogs get cooked just by getting CLOSE to dad's barbecue!
dr030620 -- The hamburgers and hot dogs are ready! - Here you go, Norm! - I wanted a hamburger! - That IS a hamburger!
dr030621 -- Ralph, I understand how you could burn hamburgers... - But how exactly did you burn the FRUIT?? I must have set the bowl too close to the burgers!
dr030622 -- Dad, do you have any napkins in the car? - Yeah, there's a bunch of 'em in the glove compartment! - Wow, you DO have a lot of napkins in here, dad! - you've got napkins from Krunchy Kakes donut shop, Down'n'Out Burgers... - Bee Bee's Bagels,
dr030622 -- Ice Cream City, Taco Emporium... - Galtburger, Yougurt'R'Us, 24-Hour Donuts, Hogg's Chili Dogs... - Chicken Heaven, Alvin's Chinese Take-Out, Dave's Donut Farm... - You know, you can tell a lot about a man by the napkins in his car! Yeah, you

dr030624 -- I guess dad was right... - He really IS a scratch golfer! - skritch skritch skritch Especially when he forgets to put on bug repellent!
dr030625 -- Why don't you take your shirt off, dad? - I'm embarrassed about my "farmer's" tan! - What's so embarrassing about a "farmer's" tan? -
dr030626 -- - Care to join me in the spa, honeybunch? bubble bubble bubble I'm beginning to understand why we still don't have our own TV series!
dr030627 -- Why do they call them "cookies"?? You don't COOK cookies, you BAKE them! - Why don't they call them BAKIES instead? - And another thing: If brownies weren't brown, would they still call them brownies?? If they were pink, would they be called
dr030627 -- PINKIES?? - Here, Penny, have a mouthful of cookie dough! mmmpphh
dr030628 -- What in the world are you doing? Trimming the tree. - Anything wrong with that? No... - ...except that it's artificial! It's bushy on one side, OK?!! - And all these years, I thought you took after ME!
dr030629 -- You know what really bugs me? - It's impossible to watch a baseball game on TV anymore... - ...without seeing a dumb guy with a cell phone trying to get on camera so he can wave at the person he's talking to! - Some people will go anywhere
dr030629 -- just to get noticed! - - Do you agree? Yep!
dr030630 -- !!! - !!! - !!! - Wow! I've never seen a sunburned tongue! Serves you right for taking your cell phone to the beach!
dr030701 -- Lackluster Video How about THIS movie, dad? - Nope. I've never seen it. I never rent movies that I haven't seen before. - Life is too short to spend two hours watching something I might not like, so I only rent movies I've already watched! -
dr030701 -- That kind of limits our choices, doesn't it? Nonsense! The three stooges made LOTS of movies!
dr030702 -- Lackluster Video Great scott!! I just thought of an idea that's going to make millions, dad!! - Try to follow me: we take the concept of a video store, but we rent BOOKS instead! - You mean, like a library? - SOMEBODY BEAT ME TO IT??
dr030703 -- Lackluster Dad, don't rent that baseball movie! We've seen it a dozen times! You know he hits a home run to win the game! - They ought to change the ending in some of these videos! - He either hits the home run, or he strikes out! Then it
dr030703 -- will be more exciting because you'll never know what will happen. How do you like that idea? - Due back on Tuesday. boop!
dr030704 -- I sure hope I don't forget to return this movie! - It's a five-day rental. Today is Friday, so it's due back next Wednesday before noon. - So, somehow, I need to remember to come all the way back here next Wednesday morning and return it! -
dr030704 -- What the heck! As long as I'm already here... Quick Drop
dr030705 -- ? - ? - Which is the wrong side of the bed that daddy said you woke up on?
dr030706 -- We'll call you when your order is ready, sir. You're number 28! Thanks! - We're number 28, Norm. Remember that number! OK, dad! - That shouldn't be too hard. 28 is an easy number to remember! - There are 28 days in February! - Except during
dr030706 -- leap year, when it has 29 days. But that only happens once every 4 years. - All the other months have 30 or 31 days. - They should take a day out of July and august and give them to February th even things out. We'd still have 365 days in the
dr030706 -- year. - LAST CALL FOR NUMBER 28! ...except we'd have 2 less days of summer and two more days of winter!
dr030707 -- One day you'll be sorry you weren't nicer to me. - One day I'll be a star! I've got talent, you know! - Talent?? What sort of talent do YOU have?? - I'll let Senor Handy answer that!
dr030708 -- That's right, Wendy! I've decided to become a famous ventriloquist! - Say something, Senor Handy! - Teeter tyter ticked a teck of tickled tetters! - What did you think of that, Wendy? Tretty Tathetic!
dr030709 -- Thanks for going out with me, Wendy! - I'm sorry I forgot my wallet and you had to pay for everything! - You were certainly a good sport about it! - Going out with you has taught me that sometimes you just have to take the bad with the really
dr030709 -- bad! Thanks!
dr030710 -- Dad, I need some fatherly advice. OK, just a second... - - Why did you put on a sweater and tie? Because this is how Robert Young always dressed on "Father Knows Best." - Everything I know about being a father, I learned from old sitcoms!
dr030710 -- That's comforting!
dr030711 -- Tell me what's wrong, son. I've come to the realization that Wendy doesn't really like me very much. - Why's that? It was because of something she said recently. - What did she say? - "I don't really like you very much." Sounds like a subtle
dr030711 -- hint!
dr030712 -- I wish I could make Wendy like me. Why? - Because then she'd want to go steady, and then she'd want to marry me! - And then she's always be nice to me because I'd be her husband! - You haven't been paying much attention around here for the
dr030712 -- last 20 years, have you?
dr030713 -- KA POK KA POK - KA POK KA POK KA POK KA POK - KA POW! - One to nothing! You know your children are growing up when you no longer feel bad about beating them at ping-pong!
dr030714 -- Here's that blouse I was looking for! - TRIP! - Ralph either needs to lose weight or hang his belt rack higher!
dr030715 -- ...128,672...128,673...128,674... What are you doing? - One of my teachers said we could never count to a million in our lifetime, so I've set out to prove him wrong! - Now, where did I leave off? - 17. Oh, yeah! 18...19...20...
dr030716 -- Is it "starve a cold, feed a fever"... - Or "feed a cold, starve a fever"? - It's "feed a cold, starve a fever." - In that case, I'll just have water!
dr030717 -- Norm, I think you're wasting your time with Wendy. You need to meet other girls! - I don't know where to meet other girls, dad! - There are 20,000 students at your college. That means at least 10,000 of them are women! - There's got to be ONE
dr030717 -- of 'em who likes you! She must attend the night classes!
dr030718 -- twist twist - WOOO! COLD! COLD! COLD! twist twist - HOT! HOT! YEEOWW!! twist twist twist twist - I hate it when I can't remember how to turn off the shower!
dr030719 -- I can't decide what color to paint the living room. - "Vanilla Cream" is pretty, but so are "Toasted Almond" and "Mocha". - I also like "Toffee Crunch," and "Butter Cookie." What do you think? - I think I'm hungry. Only YOU could get hungry
dr030719 -- looking at paint!
dr030720 -- Look what I bought, honeybunch.  - It's a door knob rope exerciser! - You hook it over the door knob, and it becomes an exercise machine! - This contraption will whip me into shape in no time! - CREAK! POP! WHAM! - You're already looking
dr030720 -- thinner!
dr030721 -- Welcome to Galtburger! - Hey, it's me. - That'll be $4.25 at the second window, please! - I come here a lot!
dr030722 -- - Good day, sir! - Urp! - "Refrigerator doorman"... my new least favorite summer job!
dr030723 -- Wendy, I hope you won't be insulted or offended by what I'm about to say... - I think we should start seeing other people. Would that be OK with you? - Ready to go, Wendy? All set! - I'll assume that was a "yes".
dr030724 -- I finally told Wendy we should start dating other people. That wasn't so bad... - Now comes the hard part... - - Eeeww! Finding another person!
dr030725 -- New Car Showroom Wow! Look at THAT car! - Isn't she a beauty?? I'd LOVE to have a car like this! - Most people see hearts before their eyes when they fall in love. Dad sees doughnuts!
dr030726 -- How was work today, Ralph? - I feel whelmed. Huh? - I didn't feel whelmed and I didn't feel underwhelmed. - I just feel whelmed.
dr030727 -- What a shot! - Birdie! - Another Birdie! - I can't believe it! - I hadn't played golf in six months... - And today I'm having the best round of golf I've ever played in my life! - I should not play golf more often! tokkl okkl!
dr030728 -- - I wonder why some creatures are attracted by lights? - Ask your father!
dr030729 -- Here's a bottle of suntan lotion, Ralph. - Don't forget to thoroughly cover your bald spot! - I hope you brought another bottle!
dr030730 -- You boys might not believe this... - But when I was younger, I had a nice head of hair! - You STILL have a nice head of hair, dad! - Only now it's on your back!
dr030731 -- There's only one thing I don't like about spending the day at the beach... - We don't get enough exercise. We just sit around! - Speak for yourself! I get LOTS of exercise! When? - Every time I try to get up out of this stupid beach chair!
dr030801 -- pick pick pick hammer hammersaw saw saw bite bite pound pound - ...Sigh... Don't get upset, dad... - You'll get the DVD out of that package eventually. So far, I hate the 21st century! Here, try a can opener!
dr030802 -- Hello, Newsradio? This is traffic tipster Drabble, calling... - Every single motorist I see is talking on a cell phone. This strikes me as very dangerous! - Say what? - Yeah, but I'm a traffic tipster! I'm exempt!!
dr030803 -- ...one glazed donut...one chocolate chip bagel... - One large frozen yogurt...one box of cheese crackers...one slice of pepperoni pizza... - One cheese and bean burrito, no onions.. What are you doing, dad? - I'm starting a new diet... - I
dr030803 -- have to write down everything I ate during the day. - It's supposed to help me examine my eating habits. - Unfortunately, I don't think I'm going to be able to stick with it. How come? - I'm getting writer's cramp!
dr030804 -- Listen, Wally...they're about to give my traffic update on the radio! - Tipster Drabble just called in to report looky-loo slowing on the south bay curve! - Tipster Steinbauer reports that tipster Drabble is driving with a dog in his lap,
dr030804 -- constituting a road menace! -
dr030805 -- Tipster Drabble just called in to report that tipster Steinbauer just made an illegal lane change. Hee hee! - And now, tipster Steinbauer reports that tipster Drabble is driving with a deployed air bag! - I AM NOT!! - Correction: that's his
dr030806 -- stomach!
dr030806 -- My suit always looks great when it comes back from the cleaners. - - - ...for about ten seconds!
dr030807 -- Now, HERE'S a class I should take next semester... - "Beginning Conversation." I already know how to converse! What an easy class! - Norman, that's a "second language" course! It's only for non-native speakers! You can't take it! - Darn! I
dr030807 -- could've had a cinch "C-Plus".
dr030808 -- What classes did you decide to take at college this fall, Norm? - Bonehead English, Bonehead Math... - Bonehead Science and Bonehead Reading! - You da man, Norm! Thanks!
dr030809 -- I think you've made a mistake, Norman...you signed up for the same class twice! - See? You signed up for algebra in the morning AND in the afternoon! - That wasn't a mistake... - I figured if I took 'em both, I was bound to pass one of them!
dr030810 -- Krunchy Kakes OK, everyone back in the car! - That was pretty cool, huh? Yeah, dad. - The next stop on our journey will be the Krunchy Kakes donut shop in El Segundo! - Then we'll head to the Krunchy Kakes shop in Palmdale... - And then we'll
dr030810 -- visit the Krunchy Kakes donut shop in Porterville, the Krunchy Kakes Donut shop in Buttonwillow, and the Krunchy Kakes donut shop in Galt! - I'm already getting sick! That's what we get for letting dad plan our summer vacation! After that,
dr030810 -- we'll stop somewhere for lunch!
dr030811 -- Well, hello, Pooch! - You're probably looking for my front yard! - It's the house on the corner! The lawn has a bunch of dead spots! You can't miss it! - None of the neighborhood dogs ever miss it! That was subtle!
dr030812 -- - Ralph, if you're going to sunbathe in the late afternoon, you need to suck in your stomach!
dr030813 -- Here's your soda,Ralph! - Can't you see my hands are full? - Just set it down someplace! -
dr030814 -- I thought you were on a diet! - How did you know I was eating a brownie? - I have eyes on the back of my head! - The only thing you have on the back of your head is skin!
dr030815 -- Slow down, Ralph! Don't drive over that speed bump! Go around it! Yes, dear! - Don't park here! We'll get a dent! Park on an end space! ...Sigh... - Mom's really a guiding influence for you, isn't she? - You might say she's the
dr030815 -- backseat-driving force in my life!
dr030816 -- dink dink dink dink dink - Is it my imagination, or was she walking a Christmas ornament?
dr030817 -- - GAH! - * * - Well, don't just stand here! DO something!! - - Can I borrow your pruning shears? CAUTION CAUTION CAUTION CAUTION
dr030818 -- Uh-oh...this movie says "Property of Lackluster Video. Please Return." - We haven't rented a movie in weeks! This must be overdue! - Don't worry. The late fees can't be THAT much! It's just a little overdue! What movie is it? - "Santa's
dr030818 -- Favorite Christmas" OK, so it's a LOT overdue!
dr030819 -- This is a Christmas movie! It's at least nine months overdue!! - "Santa's Favorite Christmas". Oh, yeah...I remember watching this! - But it wasn't last chistmas when we watched it... Thank goodness! - We watched it TWO Christmases ago!
dr030820 -- Hello, Lackluster Video? This is...uh...well, let's just call me "Johnny." - I have a hypothetical question: suppose I had a video that was two years overdue. How much would I owe in late fees? - - It didn't cost that much to MAKE this
dr030820 -- movie!! Don't worry, dad. A man of your ability can always land a second job!
dr030821 -- OK, Norm, here's our plan... "Our" plan?? - We'll take the overdue movie back to the video store, but we won't say anything... - We'll just put it back on the shelf and hope that nobody noticed it was missing! - If anyone ever asks us about
dr030821 -- it, we'll just plead ignorance! That always seems to work for us!
dr030822 -- Lackluster Video Dad, I'm scared! Relax, Norm. We're not doing anything wrong! - We're just going to sneak an overdue movie back INTO the video store. We're not sneaking anything OUT! - It's not like we're CROOKS or something! Now get going!
dr030822 -- Me?? - Why aren't YOU going? Someone needs to stay in the getaway car!
dr030823 -- Honeybunch, Norm and I just saved our family from financial ruin... - Tell me about it later. I'm looking for something. - I bought a move from the used-movie bin at Lackluster Video, and now I can't find it! - "Santa's Favorite Christmas".
dr030823 -- Have you seen it anywhere? Great. We returned a "bought" movie!
dr030824 -- Lackluster Video Fred! Ralph! - What's up? Oh, not much! - I'm just renting a few "G" rated movies for the family to watch! See? - Yeah, me too! See? "Mary Poppins", "Davy Crockett"... - Hey! An "R" rated movie! How did that get in here?? -
dr030824 -- I'll just go put that back on the shelf where it belongs! - I hate bumping into friends from church at the video store!
dr030825 -- I keep hearing my stomach growl! - I must be hungry. - You can't be hungry. You just ate dinner! Oh, yeah. - Maybe I'm sitting on the cat!
dr030826 -- How do you like my new "Donut" pool, honeybunch? - I knew there was a lot of fat in donuts, but this is ridiculous!
dr030827 -- Dad, I have some good news and some not-so-good news! - The good news is I'm going to be on television! - What's the not-so-good news? - It's a program called "World's Dumbest 911 Calls".
dr030828 -- I can't believe how much time you spend standing in front of the refrigerator! - What makes you think I spend a lot of time in front of the refrigerator? - Our floor has a permanent indentation!
dr030829 -- Patrick, why are you carrying a sofa on your back? - School starts next week, and I need to get in shape for carrying my backpack! You should probably add a few pounds!
dr030830 -- Dad, I have some good news and some bad news. - ...and some average news and some semi-good news. - And some really, really bad news, and some sort-of-good news, and some news I won't know if it's good or bad. - So which do you want to hear
dr030830 -- first? Surprise me.
dr030831 -- - - - - - - - - Why don't we just move dad's chair closer to the refrigerator? It's the only exercise he gets!
dr030901 -- Hey, Ralph! Quit parking your old car in front of my house! - It leaks oil and leaves unsightly stains all over the place! - Relax, Steinbauer! It won't be a problem any longer! - Because you're going to move it? No, because it's finally out
dr030901 -- of oil!
dr030902 -- I'm giving you one last chance to move your leaky old car, Ralph! - What are you going to do, Steinbauer? Call the police? - Worse. What I'll do to you will make you WISH you were rotting in jail! - I will place the "Steinbauer Curse" upon
dr030902 -- your head. The "Steinbauer Curse??"
dr030903 -- You're threatening to put a CURSE on me? - Give me a break! That's it, Ralph! You asked for it! - I hereby pronounce the Steinbauer Curse upon your head. May your days be filled with woe! The end. - You're in big trouble now! Ralph, my mother
dr030903 -- just called. She's coming for an extended visit!
dr030904 -- What do you mean, your mother is coming for an extended visit?? - She might stay through the holidays! The HOLIDAYS?? - How do you like the "Steinbauer Curse" so far, Ralph? - There's no such thing as a curse!! Dad, I don't know how it
dr030904 -- happened, but some of your TV remote ended up in the aquarium!
dr030905 -- Have you had enough of the "Steinbauer Curse," Ralph? - All you have to do for me to lift the curse is promise never to park your leaky car in front of my house again! - How many times do I have to tell you, Steinbauer? I don't believe in
dr030905 -- curses! - Suit yourself! Dad, how do you shut off the main water valve into our house?
dr030906 -- Yogurt I'll have my usual: chocolate and peanut butter with sprinkles! I'm sorry. We're out of those two flavors! - How could you be out of the only two flavors I like?? - Chalk another one up to the "Steinbauer Curse"! - THERE'S NO SUCH
dr030906 -- THING AS A CURSE!! We're also out of sprinkles.
dr030907 -- I like it when I'm at the beach and airplanes fly by with their Advertising. Eat More KRUNCHY KAKES Donuts - Hey, Ralph! Have Some Pop's PORK RINDS I don't like it, however, when they know I'm in my backyard and they circle the house!
dr030908 -- Lock the door! Close the blinds! - Steinbauer pronounced a curse on me! Don't be ridiculous! - I'm telling you, there's a CURSE upon my head!! - Maybe that explains your bald spot! Did he put a curse upon your stomach?
dr030909 -- Well, Ralph...are you ready for me to remove the Steinbauer Curse from your head? - All you have to do is apologize and beg for mercy. - I don't believe in the "Steinbauer Curse", and I refuse to beg you for anything! - Dad, can they raise
dr030909 -- our insurance rates if I just drove off with a gas pump hose still in the car? JUST IN CASE, ARE YOU GOING TO BE HOME ALL DAY?
dr030910 -- Ralph! What happened to your neck? nothing, yet... - But ever since Steinbauer put a curse on me, bad things have been happening! - I figure it's a good idea to put the neck brace on BEFORE I get hurt! - BONK! OW!! See? Am I smart or what??
dr030911 -- Ralph, this "Steinbauer Curse" business is silly. Nothing that bad has happened to you! Oh, really? - Your mother is coming for an extended visit, our insurance rates are going up, we've had plumbing problems... - And my TV remote fell in
dr030911 -- the fish tank! - Is that all? DID I MENTION YOUR MOTHER IS COMING TO AN EXTENDED VISIT?!!
dr030912 -- You win, Steinbauer! I beg you to remove the "Steinbauer Curse" from my head! - I beg it's customary to beg from bended knee! - NEVER! - Ralph, not only is my mother coming to visit, she's bringing her poodle, Gigi! One knee or two?
dr030913 -- I hereby remove the Steinbauer Curse! Thank you, Mr. Steinbauer! Thank you! - Good news, Ralph! My mother just arrived for her extended visit! - I THOUGHT YOU REMOVED THE CURSE!! - I removed the STEINBAUER Curse. The MOTHER-IN-LAW Curse is an
dr030913 -- entirely different thing!
dr030914 -- - - - - What?? - You ate that entire cheeseburger in only five bites! - That's a new record! It's nice to be a source of inspiration to your children!
dr030915 -- Gosh, dad, it's such a hot day... - How can you stand to wear those sweatpants?? - Your father's sweatpants are well-ventilated!
dr030916 -- Sign here, please. Aren't you going to ask to see my photo I.D.? - During a credit card transaction, the sales clerk should ALWAYS ask to see a photo I.D.. - Dad's become quite security.conscious, hasn't he? Not really... - He finally got a

dr030928 -- from here! - Aren't you going to sit down, dad? Not yet. - On second thought, I don't like it here either. Let's try the balcony.
dr030929 -- I wish I wasn't so shy. - I seem to be afraid of everybody and everything! - You should do something that will force you out of your comfort zone. That's the whole problem... - I don't even HAVE a comfort zone!
dr030930 -- I've devised a plan to overcome my shyness... - Over the course of my lifetime, I intend to say hello to every person on earth! - - ...starting with the next one!
dr031001 -- Do you really think you can say hello to every person on earth? - Just watch me... - - I said hello to to him yesterday!

dr031005 -- to lazy to do that! - Then I asked him to wear those nasal strips, but he was too lazy to do that, either! - So now I use earplugs at night, and I no longer have to listen to his incessant racket! - Doesn't it bother you to hear mom complain
dr031005 -- about you like that? Huh? - Sorry, I couldn't hear you. Your mom uses these earplugs at night, and I use 'em the rest of the day!

dr031017 -- tikka tikka tik-kitty! - What do you mean, CONGRATULATIONS?!
dr031018 -- Welcome Home, Mom and Dad! So, how was the cruise? - Great, until your dad tried to bring some jumping beans home inside the luggage. - A security guard heard the ticking sound, so he hurled the suitcase into the ocean! - Bummer! I'll say. I

dr031029 -- TRICK OR TREAT! - NOW you show up! - I sat around waiting for trick-or-treaters and no one came, so I finally just ate all the candy myself! - It's not even dark yet! - Next year, try to get here in the morning!

dr031112 -- rests.
dr031113 -- Here you are, sir! Thank you. - See, Norm? You're too nice! Why did you thank her for bringing your soda? - She's SUPPOSED to bring your soda! She gets PAID to do that! Quit being so nice!! OK. - Here's your burger! Thank you! You're killin'

dr031118 -- ...but thank you very much for calling! - You made my day! - Bye! - Wrong number. Tell me again why you thought you needed a cell phone!
dr031119 -- Speak, Wally! Speak! - woof! Good boy! - SNARF! - You're supposed to give the treats to Wally! I'm doing most of the work here!

dr031129 -- SHRIEK!! WHAT?! WHAT?! WHAT?! - I hate it when that happens! Why does she have to make the same sound when she drops a roll of paper towels as she'd make when encountering Bigfoot?
dr031130 -- Have you ever noticed that it's getting harder and harder to mail a letter? - You can't just leave 'em in your mailbox anymore because of the possibility of theft! - We used to be able to drop them in the neighborhood collection box, but they
dr031130 -- took it out! - The drive-thru receptacles at the post office are always stuffed, and the line is out the door! - The only safe way to mail a letter is to personally hand it to our letter carrier! - Excuse me... - - Sorry. I thought you were a

dr031214 -- better? I like the one on the right. - The one on the RIGHT???! The one on the right is ugly and stupid and rotten!! - We'll take the one on the left! The only tine she asks for my opinion is when she doesn't want it!

dr040518 -- Dad, why do they want YOU to give the graduation speech at the mall cop academy? - Because I'm a legend in the business! Because I am highly regarded! - Because I am widely admired! - And because their first choice backed out! Was anyone
dr040518 -- talking to you?!
dr040519 -- Esteemed colleagues, distinguished guests, and fellow mall cops... tik tik tikka tikka tik tik - We are here today to honor the graduating class of 2004. - But first, allow me to relate a humorous anectode... Slow down, dad! You're talking too
dr040519 -- fast! - How do you spell "esteemed"? *sigh* Maybe I should ask Patrick to type my speech!
dr040520 -- ...once again, congratulations and good luck! - My speech is supposed to last ten minutes. How long was that? - About 45 seconds. - Perfect! I need to allow time for several standing ovations!
dr040521 -- Is that what you're going to wear to give your graduation address to the mall cop academy? Yes, Norm. - It's customary for the graduation speaker to wear a cap and gown! - How do I look? - Like a big bottle of India ink!
dr040522 -- I really admire you for agreeing to give the graduation speech at the mall cap academy, dad! - Giving a speech infront of thousands of people would make me freeze up! - I'd be petrified! I'd get the hiccups or lose my place! I'd be paralyzed
dr040522 -- with fear! - Oh, well, have fun! Did I say THOUSANDS of people?
dr040523 -- Oops, hold on, Kathy. I have another call coming in... - boop! - Hello? Oh, hi, Denise! - *** Hold on, Denise. My cell phone is ringing! - Hello? Oh, hi, Kristine! I was just talking to Kathy and Denise... - Hold on, I have another call
dr040523 -- coming in on my cell phone! - Push the button, Ralph! boop! - Hello? Oh, hi, Carrie! First came "call waiting". Now my wife has perfected "call juggling"!
dr040524 -- Mall Cop Academy 2004 Graduation Ceremony Our graduation address will be given by Ralph Drabble. - I'm sure you will find officer Drabble's remarks enlightening and his jokes hilarious! - Officer Drabble! - We've had a slight change in the
dr040524 -- program. Instead of ten minutes, we need you to talk for an hour!
dr040525 -- Fellow mall cops, I am fortunate to have worked my way up the law enforcement ladder. - My life has been a Cinderella story, and it's not just because I have a couple of ugly sisters! - - Is this microphone on?
dr040526 -- The crowd is fidgeting and I'm sweating like a pig. I HATE public speaking! Yawn! - What could be worse than having to give a graduation address? - - ...having to give a graduation address after your notes have blown away!
dr040527 -- Man, it's HOT out there! - If nobody minds, I think I'll take off this stupid gown! - Gee, I wish I hadn't done that. - Apparently, I forgot to put on pants!
dr040528 -- So. how was your graduation address to the mall cop academy? - Nobody laughed at my jokes, the wind blew my speech away, and I forgot to wear pants. - - Aside from that, did it go OK? He also hyperventilated!
dr040529 -- AAARRRRGH! - * * * hobble hobble - Huff! Puff! Looks like you've hit middle age, dad! - *I* didn't hit middle age, middle age hit *ME*!
dr040530 -- Daddy, can I have a yogurt? Sure, Penny! - Can I have two flavors? Of course! - Can I have a large instead of a small! If you want! - Can I have sprinkles on top? Fine with me! - Can I have sprinkles AND chocolate chips? I suppose. - Can I
dr040530 -- have TWO large yogurts? No. - - WAAAAAHH!
dr040531 -- - This is what you'd look behind bars. - And this what you'd look like during an eclipse. - That's what you'd look like with a hot fudge sundae on your head!
dr040601 -- Sometimes I worry that you don't like me. - Allow me to put your mind at rest. - Sleep! - Z
dr040602 -- My diet is working, honeybunch! - I've lost two inches of my waist! Really? Let me see! - Can I have some *puff* ice cream now?
dr040603 -- Dang! I can't find my remote! - Wait...I feel something under the cushion! - Sweet! Find-it? - No, but I found an easter egg!
dr040604 -- Before the doctor sees you, Mr. Drabble, you'll need to answer a few questions... - Have you had any recent depression? No. - Any dizziness? No. Any insomnia? No. - Have you experienced any irritability? Just my wife's.
dr040605 -- Norman, I told you to turn the TV OFF! I am, mom! flip flip flip - But you can't just turn it off, you have to turn it off on a GOOD CHANNEL! - For example, you should never turn it off on the surgery channel because the next time you turn on
dr040605 -- the TV, who knows WHAT you may see! - I wish you put this much thought into your homework! The golf channel! That's a good one to turn it off on!
dr040606 -- I'm home! - Hello, Wally! skattle skattle skattle - Now, this is how I like to be greeted when I come home from work! - With joy and excitement! My family can learn a lot from you, Wally! - All of you should greet me with such enthusiasm! -
dr040606 -- OK, maybe not!
dr040607 -- ...my cholesterol, my blood pressure... - My weight and my stress level. - - Never ask dad "what's up?" Oh, yeah...and my financial debt!
dr040608 -- What's for dinner? Chicken casserole. - - What's for dinner tomorrow? Pizza. - YES! ...assuming you live that long!
dr040609 -- Sweet! The pool is filled! - COWABUNGA!! - Whenever I go in the pool with dad, I never get wet!
dr040610 -- I know you're busy, Norman, but somebody needs to take him outside for a walk! Z - He's been inside the house all day. He needs exercise! OK. - Come on, dad. Let's go for a walk! Z
dr040611 -- Here's your ice cream, Ralph. - Very funny, honeybunch. Well, you always complain about brain freezes. - I thought it would help if you didn't eat so fast! - She installed speed bumps on my ice cream spoon!
dr040612 -- ACHOO! Bless you. - ACHOO! Bless you. - ACHOO! Bless you. - ACHOO! You're on your own.
dr040613 -- bop! - - bop! - BAM! Nice spike. Thanks!
dr040614 -- What are you watching? Seniors auto racing. - Seniors? Yeah, it's like the seniors tour in golf. - All the participants are over 50! - That probably explains why so many of them are driving with their blinkers on.
dr040615 -- Keep going! I see a good spot over there! This is heavy! Can somebody help me with this cooler?! - It would probably have been easier just to bring the sand and water to our house! Can we rest a while while we unload the rest of the car?
dr040616 -- - - -
dr040617 -- - LOOK OUT BELOW! - SPLOOSH! - Coast Guard Mr Drabble, the people of Japan are calling, asking you to stop doing cannonballs in the ocean!
dr040618 -- I'd like peanut butter fudge on the bottom, then some strawberry and some banana. - And then a little bit of raspberry, and a smidgen of butterscotch on the top - On second thought, make it all vanilla!
dr040619 -- RING! - SHE'S NOT HOME! - -
dr040620 -- So, what would you like to do today, dad? Well, here's what I've decided... - First, I'm going to eat a big bowl of ice cream! - Then, I'm going to watch a ball game on TV! - After that, I'll take a nap, and when I wake up, I'll have some
dr040620 -- more ice cream! - Then I'll relax until dinner. After that, I'll watch a little more TV, then I'll go to bed early! - How's THAT for a plan? - That's exactly what you do EVERY Sunday! Yeah, we were hoping you'd want to do something different
dr040620 -- for father's day! If it ain't broke, don't fix it!
dr040621 -- It's about 78°, partly cloudy, with winds light and variable! - Anyway, as I was saying, summers on my uncle Ned's farm were very boring... - What's the weather like outside NOW, Norman? - I'll go check again! Remember, take your time!
dr040622 -- I really stuck to my diet today, honeybunch. All I had was a salad! - All you had the entire day was a salad?? ...and a couple of Granola bars. - ...and a few cookies, and a chili dog...and a sack of chips. - This conversation is making me
dr040622 -- hungry!
dr040623 -- AH HA HA HA - HEE HEE HA HA HA! - HOO HOO HOO HAW HAW! - I take it that's a "no" to my "family camping trip" idea. - Yeah, but thanks for a good laugh!
dr040624 -- Ralph, at least do me the courtesy of CONSIDERING a family camping trip before saying no! - All right, honeybunch... - I'll think about it. No. - You only thought about it for half a second! That's three-tenths of a second longer than I
dr040624 -- needed!
dr040625 -- Ralph, why don't you want to take a family camping trip? - It would be an opportunity for bonding! - You know something, you're right. It WOULD lead to bonding... - Not to mention casts, slings and stitches!
dr040626 -- Ralph, what have you got against camping?? - Honeybunch, camping is just plain wrong. - For thousands of years, man has known that it is better to sleep Indoors than OUTdoors! - That's why we were called CAVEmen instead of OUTSIDEmen! Leave
dr040626 -- your relatives out of it!
dr040627 -- Uh-oh... - RALPH Don't eat all the brownies. Don't try to fix the sink-I'll call a plumber. Don't forget to put away your junk. Don't trim the trees. You always make them look worse! Don't tease the cat. Don't mess up the living room. H.B. -
dr040627 -- Most wives give their husbands a "honey-do" list. My wife gives me a "honey-don't" list!
dr040628 -- Ralph, you're being unreasonable! Honeybunch, for the last time, we are NOT going camping! - Absolutely no way, ho how! Read my lips: No camping trip! - And that's final! - How much longer until we get there, dad?
dr040629 -- Congratulate me, honeybunch! I remembered to pack the cheese and crackers! - Can you imagine how awful this camping trip would've been if I forgot the cheese and crackers? - Congratulations. strakk - Now go unpack the sleeping bags! The
dr040629 -- whats?
dr040630 -- Who can tell me why we hang our food from a tree? - We do it to keep the bears from getting into it and eating it all! - Yeah, them, too!
dr040701 -- - Uh-oh... - We're already out of insect repellent! - You're supposed to spray it on YOURSELF, not in the AIR!! Oh.
dr040702 -- The campground brochure that the ranger gave us is very helpful. - It tells you what to do if you encounter a mountain lion, a bear, a rattlesnake, a swarm of bees and quicksand! - It also has many interesting facts... - Did you know 12 dead
dr040702 -- bodies have been discovered here? I'm gonna sleep in the car, OK, dad?
dr040703 -- Once upon a time... AAAHHH!! - There was an old man... THAT'S ENOUGH! I CAN'T TAKE IT!! - OK, we won't tell ghost stories! How about if we just ell our favorite episodes of Winnie The Pooh?
dr040704 -- - BONK! - Sorry about that! CAUTION: HARD HAT AREA
dr040705 -- Look at all the stars, Penny! Wow! - Can you point to the big dipper? - I said the big dip-PER!
dr040706 -- I'm going to bed, Norm! You're on bear watch, tonight! - Bear watch?? If any bears get close to our tent, your job is to fight 'em off! - With wat??!! Oh, yeah...you'll need a weapon, won't you? - Nighty-night!
dr040707 -- Dad, what am I supposed to do if I see a bear?! - Just scare it away! How do I do that? - Act like you're really big! - How do I act like I'm really big?? Do I have to think of everything, Norm?
dr040708 -- Dad, maybe YOU should watch for bears tonight! - I need my rest, Norm. I'm tired from driving all day! - Just relax! The odds of encountering a bear at this campground re remote! - It's much more likely you'll encounter an escaped convict!
dr040709 -- Why do *I* have to stay up all night looking out for bears? - I don't even know what I'm supposed to do if... - Whoa! What's that?!! - Oh, no!! To be continued tomorrow! But don't get your hopes up, because it's really not that exciting!
dr040710 -- Sometimes it's coming toward us! - Now, what did dad say to do if I saw a bear? Oh, yeah...scare it away by acting big! - One sausage pizza? YO! Booga booga!
dr040711 -- ? - - - - Ralph, what's going on in here?? I can't find the TV remote! - It's right here in the drawer, where it belongs! - - WHY WOULD ANYONE EVER THINK TO LOOK IN THERE?
dr040712 -- No Bills Over $20 - *  - Sorry, Mr. Drabble. No Bills Over $20 I have to deliver them all! Dang.
dr040713 -- Ralph, our front lawn could use your attention! - Our front lawn?? What's wrong with our front lawn?! - Our front lawn looks like a GOLF COURSE! - Only because it's got 18 holes!
dr040714 -- Change Let's see... - How does this work? - "Insert Bills Face-Up" -
dr040715 -- Aw, what the heck... - One more doughnut won't hurt! - KABLOOIE! - Most people's belts wear out. Dad's belts explode!
dr040716 -- RING - HOWW-DEEE! - click! - that's one way to weed out the phone solicitors!
dr040717 -- I've been working on my goatee, honeybunch! - How does it look? - It's very becoming! - It's becoming very stupid looking!
dr040718 -- He's circling the tank! Get your camera ready! - Here he comes! - - What was that?? Sha-MOO! - We, here at "Drabble", wish to apologize for the stupidity of today's strip! What about yesterday's?
dr040719 -- bop bop bop bop bop bop - bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop - snatch! - POW!
dr040720 -- Whoa! - - If You Build It, I Will Come! They're considering building a new doughnut shop here!
dr040721 -- ...10_59 and 45 seconds... - 1:59 and 55 seconds...ELEVEN O'CLOCK!! - Lights out! click! - There are some days you just can't wait to see end!
dr040722 -- Say when! When. - Any time yo want! When! - I don't care! It's your drink! WHEN!! - See what happens when you're indecisive?!
dr040723 -- KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE BALL!! SWING LEVEL!! - QUICK BAT! STEP INTO IT! TRUST YOUR HANDS! - OK, I'm going to the field, now. I promised him I wouldn't yell at him during his game!
dr040724 -- YAY, PATRICK!! NICE HIT!! - I never realized your son was such a good base ball player, Ralph! - How did he get so good? I taught him everything I know! - SO THEN, HE DID JUST THE OPPOSITE!
dr040725 -- - - - - - - - That's the ticket! - Please can I play golf instead of going to your mother's? The answer is still no, but congratulations on one of your better faces!
dr040726 -- LOOK OUT BELOW!! - Help. Dad's stuck in the water slide again! I'll get the crowbar!
dr040727 -- Honeybunch, will you put sunscreen on my back? - RING! - Telephone! - Oops, sorry! I forgot to rub it in!
dr040728 -- Sweet! Oreo cookies! - ? - How come there's in any of these?! - Say what?

dr040730 -- Ralph, I bought grape juice pouches for the kids! - Just remember, grape juice stains, and these juice pouches can be messy! - So, if they want one, make sure they drink it outside, in old clothing! - Daddy, can I have a grape juice pouch?
dr040730 -- No.
dr040731 -- Here you go, Mr. Drabble! - Hey, you've got a cup from BURGER QUEEN in your car! - You've been going to other drive-thrus! I was in another town! I was thirsty! - I have a whole different set of problems from most people!
dr040801 -- An armoire?? Where did THIS come from? - Why would she put something like THIS in here?? - There's no room in here for this big, bulky piece of furniture! - Besides, it's ugly! - What was she THINKING? We need this in here like a hole in the
dr040801 -- head! - How do you like our new armoire? I LOVE it!
dr040802 -- Boy, it's hot outside! - If I were me, I'd go jump in the pool! - - Oh, yeah, huh! It's thrilling to see a great mind at work!
dr040803 -- HERE I COME! OPEN THE FRONT DOOR! - - - It's impossible to get out of this house without getting covered with cat hair!
dr040804 -- Remember what you always said, dad... - "The worst day on the golf course is better than the best day at work"!
dr040805 -- Here they are...juice boxes! What flavor do you want, Norm? - Don't buy any, dad. Those are for kids! - Besides it's getting crowded in here!

dr040809 -- It seemed like an ordinary night... Let's go outside, Wally! - But for Ralph Drabble, the peace and calm of a summer evening would soon be shattered forever. - For events were about to unfold which would completely and forever alter the lives
dr040809 -- of each and every member of the fam... Hey, quit crowding me out of the picture! - Sorry. Stupid narration boxes!
dr040810 -- Ralph Drabble's peaceful evening is about to be interrupted... - Gasp! - The sign of the corn dog! That means officer Drabble is needed at the mall! - See? We narration boxes always know what's going to happen! I'M ON MY WAY!
dr040811 -- The sign of th corn dog! - The universal signal that officer Drabble is needed at the mall! - I must quickly change into my mall cop uniform, and...oh, crud! - Give me back my underwear. It was my last pair!
dr040812 -- The sin of the corn dog! I am needed at the mall! But dad, you got laid-off last year! - Obviously, a crisis has arisen that the younger mall copy are unable to deal with! - I'm be in summoned out of retirement! It's time once again to put on
dr040812 -- the uniform! - Unfortunately, I seem to have gained a little weight!

dr040814 -- Responding to the signal, officer Drabble arrives at the mall. Huff! Puff! Ralph! Thank goodness you're here! - Once a mall cop, always a mall cop! How can I be of service? - When we laid you off last year, we forgot to take back your key to

dr040816 -- Wendy, there's something I've been waiting to ask you... - I hope it's not too forward of me... - But I can't control myself any longer. - May I press down all the little buttons on your plastic drink lid?
dr040817 -- Ralph, don't put your glass on the table! It will leave a ring! - And don't put it on my new magazine! Use a coaster! - On second thought, those are new coasters! Don't use those! ...sigh... - Hey, you're getting the sidewalk wet! slurp slurp

dr040927 -- It is day 8 of Ralph Drabble's extreme makeover! - As part of his exercise program, Ralph is now jogging instead of driving a car! - May I take your order, please? Two cheeseburgers and a chocolate shake!
dr040928 -- Last week on "Extensive Makeover!, Ralph Drabble met his makeover team! - It's now day 9! Let's look at the amazing transformation that has taken place... - Pass the pork rinds! Hey, where's the remote? Shall we call for another pizza? These
dr040928 -- sweat pants are comfy!
dr040929 -- Remember the old saying: "There is no *I* in TEAM"! - No, but there's a "me". - And a "met" and a "tam". - And "meat" and "tame". "eat" and "ate". - How come I always get the "gifted" kids? "Tea". "Mat". "Mate".
dr040930 -- Quit complaining! - When I was a little kid, I had to walk to school through snow and sleet! - Yeah, but I'll bet you didn't have a fifty-pound back pack! Good point.
dr041001 -- HELP! - I'VE FALLEN AND I CAN'T GET UP! -
dr041002 -- Well, I don't know what you've been complaining about... - According to our scale, your backpack only weighs three pounds! - I could've sworn it was heavier than that! Keep in mind our scale also says that dad weighs 185!
dr041003 -- SWISH - SWISH - swoosh - SWOOSH! - SWISH - SWISH! - SPLAT KLUNK
dr041004 -- - Ralph, you didn't need three sheets to wipe that up! - Two would've been plenty! Stop being so wasteful! - Some husbands gamble, some husbands carouse...I get in trouble for using too many paper towels!
dr041005 -- Poor kid. - I know it's hard carrying all those heavy books on your back... - One day, it will all pay off! - When I grow up, I'll be able to get a job as a pack mule at the Grand Canyon!
dr041006 -- I'm off to school! - It's a shame that you have to lug that heavy backpack to and from school every day! - You could drive me! - I could, but it's all uphill, and our car only has a V-six engine!
dr041007 -- The principal saw my backpack and said it was too much weight for a child to be carrying on his back. - Good for him! It's about time somebody addressed the problem! - Did he take away some of your books? - No, he gave me another back pack!
dr041008 -- Ralph! Quit biting your nails! - Human beings are SUPPOSED to bite their nails! How do you figure that? The good lord gave us nails and he gave us teeth... - You do the math! Some of your teeth might be on a loan!
dr041009 -- Who are you going to vote for this year, dad? None of your business! - There's a reason why we have a secret ballot. If everyone said who they were voting for, they'd be subject to intimidation and peer pressure. - Gee, dad...you're pretty
dr041009 -- smart! - We're having an election this year??
dr041010 -- RING - boop - Hello? - ? - - - KONK! - I think cell phones have gotten a little too small!
dr041011 -- Just relax, Mr. Drabble, and we'll fix that tooth! - I'm going to tilt your chair back a bit... - Oops! I guess that was a little too far!
dr041012 -- Try this DVD headset, Mr. Drabble! You can watch a movie while I work on your teeth! - - AAAAAAAHHH!! - I haven't even started yet! Sorry...I'm watching "Jurassic Park"!
dr041013 -- Mr. Drabble, you're going to feel a little sting... - And that's just when you say your bill! - AH HA HA HA! - Seriously, this is going to hurt like the dickens! Now I know why he crams all this stuff in my mouth-it makes it hard to scream!
dr041014 -- KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK - ARF! ARF! ARF! ARF! ARF! ARF! ARF! ARF! ARF! ARF! ARF! ARF! ARF! ARF! - Relax. It's just me! - I know. I was trying to stay sharp!
dr041015 -- Norman, you shouldn't tuck your tie into your pants! - Sorry...I'm not very good at tying ties! - I tucked it in my pants to hide the fact that it's too long! - It didn't help.
dr041016 -- Blow out your candles, Patrick! - But this year, be careful! - See if you can blow them out without spitting all over the cake! OK. -
dr041017 -- How did it go at the dentist, Ralph? - Oh, fine! No problems at all! - I'm glad you finally gathered the courage to go! I know you have a fear of dental procedures! - Who, me?? Naw...modern dentistry is virtually pain-free! - I wasn't afraid
dr041017 -- at all! It was a piece of cake! - There you go! Let's get back in the chair, Mr. Drabble! NO, I WANT TO Be DONE NOW!
dr041018 -- I'm tired of being a nobody, dad... - I've decided to become a SOMEBODY. - The problem is, I don't know HOW to become a somebody! - Figure out how you became a nobody, and then do the opposite!
dr041019 -- Norm, if you want to be a somebody, you've got to LOOK like a somebody! - How do I do that? First, hold your chin up high! - Which might be a little tricky, since you don't HAVE a chin! Hee hee! - Why don't you loan him one of yours, Ralph?
dr041020 -- I'm tired of being a nobody! - What makes you feel like a nobody? - Hey! Where'd you go?! - Oh, there you are! Little things like that.
dr041021 -- I'm tired of being a nobody. - I want to be a SOMEBODY. - If I were a somebody, I'd always sign autographs and smile at kids - I'd make a good somebody!
dr041022 -- I want to be a SOMEBODY! I just don't know how! - Son, you become a somebody by trying to do the right thing... - Work hard, treat people well, listen to your parents and obey the law! - I've GOT it! I need to win an AWARD of some kind! Did I
dr041022 -- mention listening to your parents?
dr041023 -- Ah ha! Just as I suspected! - It says in the paper that a child's backpack should not exceed 15% of the child's body weight! - I'm going to call the principal! - What did he say? He recommends our child gain some weight!
dr041024 -- Four pumpkins...that will be $20, please! - Here's a twenty dollar bill! - Oh, wait! That was one of the NEW twenty dollar bills! Let me give you an old twenty instead! - They redesigned it a few years ago, and I like the new style much
dr041024 -- better. - I don't even like to have the old twenties in my purse! The new bills are much prettier! - I always spend the old twenties to get rid of them! - You're right, dad. Mom really DOES spend money like it's going out of style!
dr041025 -- Maybe I could be a policeman...or a fireman... - Those are both great occupations, Norm! - I'm glad you're finally thinking about your future! - Yeah, it's about time I figured out what to be for Halloween!
dr041026 -- Trick or treat! - What the heck is THAT?? A Hallowiener Dog!
dr041027 -- Trick or treat! - Hey, it's baseball slugger BARRY BONDS! Great costume! - Here you go! - Hey, what's the big idea?! I threw you for wide ones!
dr041028 -- BOO! Whoa! You kids are scary! - Here you go1 - DING DONG - BOO! Weren't you here before? Deja boo!
dr041029 -- Yeah, I know...uh-huh...hang on... - Trick or treat! . HEY, LOOK OUT! BEEP! So, anyway, like I was saying... The scariest costume of the night: a driver on a cell phone.
dr041030 -- TRICK OR TREAT! - Very funny. You look like me! Very realistic! - OK, here's a treat! I'll need more. Why? - There are three other kids inside here!
dr041031 -- Trick or treat! - Wow! What a costume! - Did you make it yourself? - That is, by far, the best costume of the night! - Let me take a picture! - Congratulations! Bye-bye! - KNOCK KNOCK! - You didn't give me any candy! Hey! Look! Look! Is that
dr041031 -- a full moon?
dr041101 -- Vote Vote - - Steinbauer! - Before entering the voting booth, it's fun to think of one special person whose vote I'm about to cancel out!
dr041102 -- ...Step 7: you put your right foot out. - Step 8: you put your right foot in...Step 9: you shake it all about. - Ker-CHUNK! - I don't think they succeeded at simplifying the voting process!
dr041103 -- I'm just about ready for you to take the Halloween decorations up to the attic! - I just need to put a little grin on the jack-o-lantern...there! - You know you're a compulsive decorator when you decorate boxes of decorations!
dr041104 -- Let me borrow your back, dad. I need to write on something. - This won't work! Your back is too squishy! - I need a harder surface! - Try the top of his head!
dr041105 -- Norman, sometimes you really really bug me. - But then other times... - You just really bug me! - How nice of you to say. And the rest of the time, you just bug me.
dr041106 -- Hi, Mr. Drabble. Hello, Kendall. - I've come to ask for your daughter's hand in marriage. - Sorry, Kendall. You're too young! - That's what you said LAST week!

dr041112 -- I'm glad there are still a few shows on TV that the entire family can watch together! - Now if only they didn't have to show promos for the sleazy show that comes on next!
dr041113 -- Now, where are those clickers? - Hey, I just thought of a great idea!! I'll make millions!! - Since the remote gets misplaced so often, they should put buttons DIRECTLY ON THE TV! Then you wouldn't NEED the remote!! - Like this? You mean,
dr041113 -- someone beat me to it?!
dr041114 -- Excuse me...we just went through the drive-thru and we didn't get our fries. You didn't get your fries?? - THIS MAN DIDN'T GET HIS FRIES! WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS? - I am, sir! YOU'RE FIRED! - Please don't fire me, sir! I need this job!

dr050123 -- in the hand gathers no moss. But never look a rolling stone in the mouth! - WHEN WILL THAT SWEATER BE READY?!
dr050124 -- BASH! - Well, at least now we know never to toss a ball up into a ceiling fan, again! Let's not play "What would happen if..." anymore!
dr050125 -- - - - May stack of bills is like Snoopy's stack of bones in "A Charlie Brown Christmas." It never gets any smaller!
dr050126 -- Ralph! What are you doing?? - I'm just having a little something to tide me over until dinner, honeybunch! - Dinner is in TWO MINUTES! - In that case, I'll only have one more!
dr050127 -- ARRRRGG! - - Why did you do that? Because it was here! Feel free to help out with the laundry sometime!
dr050128 -- Dad, why do you keep all these old TV clickers that don't work anymore? - THEY STILL WORK! - If you tape them all together, they'll reach the buttons on the TV!
dr050129 -- SLOSH SLOSH SLOSH - You were right. It's hard to make snow angels in the rain! Nice try, though.
dr050130 -- Hello! Welcome to All-Mart! Hello! - Hi, Welcome to All-Mart! Hello! Hello! Welcome to All-Mart! Hello! - - - - I'm such a nobody, even the All-Mart greeter ignores me! Hello! Welcome to All-Mart! Hello!
dr050131 -- Ralph, I have a question... - Why on earth would you eat a donut right before you drink a diet shake? - Because after I drink the diet shake, I won't be hungry anymore! - That was kind of a no-brainer!
dr050201 -- - The weatherman did say there was only a 50% chance of snow today!
dr050202 -- - GRRRRRRR - What the heck... - The Steinbauers got a new dog! Dog? I thought it was Batman! grrrrrr

dr050204 -- That new puppy of yours is kind of scary, Steinbauer! - Relax, Ralph! Wolfgang has a very pleasant disposition, and he has been trained to respond to my command! - Watch this...sit, Wolfgang! Sit! - GRRRRRRRRR OK! OK! Maybe later!
dr050205 -- Wolfgang is my new puppy! Puppy?? - Say hello to Mr. Drabble, Wolfgang! - BARK BARK BARK - Sorry, Ralph. Wolfgang has been trained to bark at undesirables!
dr050206 -- First, I'll put on my sweat pants.. - Then my sweatshirt... - My head band... - Wrist bands... - And now I'm ready to feel the burn! - groan grunt! ARRRRGGHH!! It's kind of sad when you need to wear workout clothes just to put your socks on!
dr050207 -- BARK BARK BARK BARK BARK BARK BARK BARK BARK - How can you stand being in the backyard with the neighbor's dog barking at you? Maybe I'll go inside. - WHY ARE YOU RELAXING WHEN THE SINK NEEDS FIXING, THE WALL NEEDS PAINTING, THE YARD NEEDS...

dr050210 -- - - - Take those speed bumps a little slower, son. Sorry!
dr050211 -- Monday is Valentines Day. - I bought a card, addressed it to myself, stamped it, and I'll mail it! All you have to do is sign it! - Sorry. My pen just ran out of ink. - That's OK. It's the thought that counts!
dr050212 -- Ralph, I'm glad you're home! - The sink is clogged, the roof is leaking and the garage door is broken. - Oh, and the garbage disposal needs to be replaced. - Whenever the wife says she's glad you're home, look out!
dr050213 -- Hello, Wendy! Norman, I have a question for you... - Why did you send me a sympathy card? A what?? - "With deepest condolences for the love of your beloved husband" - Oh, I can explain... - I got mixed up. I meant to send you a VALENTINES
dr050213 -- card! - I see. Well, thank you anyway! - It's going to be harder to explain it to old Mrs. Hogenboomer!
dr050214 -- Valentine's candy?? For ME?? Before you get excited, let me explain... - I bought several of these to give to all my close friends! You consider me a close friend?? - No, but I had one left over! - I was going to give it to the garbage man,
dr050214 -- but he doesn't come until Friday- This is the best valentine's day ever!!
dr050215 -- Go ahead! Try me! OK, let's see... - Who led the national league in triples in 1958? - I forgot! Wow! That's amazing!! - Dad's right! He's forgotten more about baseball than I'll EVER know!
dr050216 -- There! I put a sticky note on the refrigerator reminding me of my dental appointment! - But I'll never remember to read it! - scribble scribble - There! A sticky note to remind me to read the other sticky note!
dr050217 -- I'd like to pay with a credit card. - May I see a picture I.D.? - If you insist... - I was thinking more along the lines of a driver's license. My driver's license photo is embarrassing!
dr050218 -- Here she comes! - - ...yes, I love you, too, darling! - Your phone is upside-down. So much for the old jealousy ploy!
dr050219 -- - PUSH PUSH SHOVE SHOVE - This is probably a silly question, but do you like my new cologne?
dr050220 -- - - You dogs are all alike... - You follow the big guy all over the house because you want him to like you best! - SNARF! - No, I follow him around because I know I'll eventually get something to eat!
dr050221 -- This is my favorite program: the extreme home makeover show! - Each week, they select a deserving family and completely remodel their house! And they send them on a cool vacation while they do it! - How do they pick the family? People send in
dr050221 -- application videos explaining why they need it! - Uh-oh. Hide the camcorder!
dr050222 -- ...and, ACTION! Hello. I'm Ralph Drabble and I'd like to apply for an extreme home makeover! - When you hear my gut-wrenching story, I'm sure you'll want to come right out and get to work! - In the meantime, I strongly suggest you grab a box
dr050222 -- of tissues!
dr050223 -- Application Video I believe our house qualifies for an extreme makeover! - I'm embarrassed to live in such squalor! - Look! I have to put a pot on the floor because the roof leaks. - AND IT'S NOT EVEN RAINING OUTSIDE!!
dr050224 -- I'm not applying for this extreme home makeover for my own sake... - It's for my good wife, who works her fingers to the bone raising our three children. - I was hoping you could redo our yard and install one of those big, synthetic putting
dr050224 -- greens for her! - She doesn't like golf but at least she wouldn't have to mow the lawn any more!
dr050225 -- Here's one of our biggest problems: our neighbor, Mr. Steinbauer! - He's the worst neighbor EVER! Is it any wonder why I'm a nervous wreck?? - If you're applying for a home makeover, forget it! As president of the Neighborhood Homeowners
dr050225 -- Association, we'd never approve any drastic changes! - Hopefully, you'll have to knock down his house to make room for my new pool!
dr050226 -- Well, that's my application video! I look forward to the arrival of the Extreme Home Makeover team! - We'll pack our bags for the fabulous vacation you'll send us on while you're fixing up this dump! - Remember, I'd like a home theater, a
dr050226 -- rumpus room, an indoor gym and a built-in barbecue! I hope it's not too much to ask! - If it is, just send us on the vacation!
dr050227 -- Hello! Welcome to All-Mart! - Welcome to All-Mart! - Hi! Welcome to All-Mart! - Mrs. Drabble! - - Something tells me you do a lot of shopping here. I do seem to get a warmer welcome than most!
dr050228 -- Take my advice, son... - When you grow up and take a bride, get married on her birthday! - That way, if you forget her birthday and your anniversary, you'll only get trouble once a year. - Thanks, dad. Mind if I stay up here in your treehouse
dr050228 -- for a few days?
dr050301 -- HA HA ho ho ho HEE HEE HEE chuckle hoo hoo hoo I love it when the sound of laughter fills the house, don't you, Ralph? Sure. - ...except when they're laughing at all my photo I.D.'s! HEE HEE HEE HOO HOO Whoa! This one is gnarly!!

dr050304 -- Hello! - Honeybunch? Norm? Patrick? Penny? - I guess nobody's home! - I'd bite him if I had any teeth!
dr050305 -- Let me raise your chair a little bit, Mr. Drabble, and we'll check those teeth! - whirrrrrr - How come you raised it so high? Oh, sorry! I used to be a garage mechanic!
dr050306 -- Welcome TO All-Mart - Hey! You didn't welcome me to All-Mart! Your job is to say "Welcome to All-Mart" to everyone who comes in! I'm on my break! - When will your break be over? Thirteen minutes. - OK! - - - HEY! My mistake. I should've said
dr050306 -- fourteen minutes!

dr050312 -- Some people say we should have eyes on the backs of our heads. - I think we should have eyes on our hands. That way, if you're at a parade and you want to see better... - All you have to do is this! - Of course, then you'd need a really big
dr050312 -- pair of sunglasses! Norman, RUN!
dr050313 -- I'm back from spending the weekend at my sister's! - Wow! Don't you all look festive! Did you decide to get a head start on St-Patrick's Day? No, we decided to let Norman do the laundry!
dr050314 -- - whirrrr How was your weekend, Norman? - My Weekend? Uh, well, let's see...on Friday night, I watched TV and played video games...then, uh...uh... whirrrrrr!! - DANG it! Norman's fun to converse with if if you catch him at the right time!
dr050315 -- - Those who fail to remember the past are doomed to repeat it! - I know. - You told me that yesterday! Oh, yeah. Sorry!
dr050316 -- - Yeah, this is a little better, but I STILL think you should buy a big screen!
dr050317 -- OW!! - Norman, it's Saint Patrick's Day and you're not wearing green! - What were you thinking?? - I was thinking I'd like to have Wendy pinch me!
dr050318 -- We took a field trip to a museum today. - What did you see? - A bunch of naked statues. Oh, well... - I guess it's good to be exposed to the arts! Or vice versa.
dr050319 -- I hate tabulating my income taxes. - It's always a painful experience! - tappity tappity tap tap tap - That's because I bite my nails too short!

dr050321 -- Sorry! The rocket ride is closed for repairs. - Sorry! The space bomber ride is closed today. - Sorry! The laser beam ride is closed for inspection. - Now I know why they call this "Tomorrow World." If you want to go on any rides, you have to

dr050323 -- Ralph, when will you quit procrastinating and fix our leaky roof? - I can't fix it in the rain, honeybunch! - Sometime you just have to make the best of a bad situation!
dr050324 -- Would I look more handsome with glasses? - Absolutely not! - Then I'd REALLY be able to see all your imperfections! - I meant if *I* wore glasses! Oh...couldn't hurt!
dr050325 -- I'm always surprised that you continue to go out with me, when you never seem to have a good time! - I've come to the conclusion that being with you is my punishment for misdeeds I must have committed in a previous life. - When I spend time
dr050325 -- with you, I feel like I'm paying my debt to society! - I'm glad I can help. I just don't know what on earth I could have possibly done that was so BAD!!
dr050326 -- Yes, uh-huh... - What? You're breaking up! - Hello? Hello? Can you hear me?? - Oh, sorry! I always lose reception when I walk behind my dad!

dr050331 -- Have a seat, Mr. Drabble! - The doctor will see you shortly. Uh-huh. - When they say the doctor will see you shortly, it doesn't mean he'll see you SOON... - It means when he finally DOES see you, it won't be for very long!
dr050401 -- Mr. Drabble, I've studied your test results, and I'm afraid it's bad news. - In fact, it's the worst. I hope your affairs are in order. - - HA HA HA HA HA HA Never go in for a checkup on april fools' day!
dr050402 -- This is my favorite day of the year! How come? - Because baseball season starts tomorrow! - Then why isn't TOMORROW your favorite day of the year? - Because today the cubs are still tied for first place!

dr050403 -- Don't forget wedding anniversary next week! - Today I've discovered that my handwriting goes bad after a few days! I think it says something about "anteaters". Instead of putting your notes ON the refrigerator, maybe you should put then IN
dr050403 -- the refrigerator!
dr050404 -- BAD CALL, REF! YOU'RE LAZY! - Zip it, Steinbauer! I will not tolerate criticism from the sidelines! - Don't make me get up and come over there!
dr050405 -- - - - I always think it's ironic when she leaves her "good housekeeping" magazines all over the place!
dr050406 -- It's bright outside! - Better wear the shades! - RIP! YEOUCH! - Men with hairy chests should not hand sunglasses on the front of their shirts! Did you used to hang them on the back of your head, too?
dr050407 -- I'm off to the golf club, honeybunch! - OK. Try not to make a complete fool of yourself! - Don't lose all the balls this time! - Mom isn't exactly the wind beneath your wings, is she? More like a tropical depression!
dr050408 -- Dad, will you blow up my new beach ball? - Why can't YOU blow it up? You have more BREATH than I do! - Mom always says you're full of hot air! - It's nice to know I'm so well-respected! And use a breath mint in  case it pops!
dr050409 -- It's time to check on our local fast food drive-thru traffic conditions... - A heavy back-up is reported at the McDoogle's drive-through. Expect a ten-minute wait! - Traffic is moving smoothly at the Taco Hut drive-thru, but over at

dr050411 -- Due to the graphic nature of the following program, viewer discretion is advised. - CLICK! - It said VIEWER discretion, not MOTHER OF VIEWER discretion! Too bad!

dr050413 -- Wally, what's wrong with you?? - Are you going to let the neighbor's puppy intimidate you? - You can't jump inside my shirt every time you're frightened! - That's right, Wally. There's barely enough room for HIM inside his shirt!
dr050414 -- It's fun to watch kids play baseball! - Baseball teaches the children teamwork and sportsmanship! - STRIKE THREE?? YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED, UMP!! SHOW SOME INTEGRITY!! - I'm not sure what it teaches the parents! WE KNOW WHICH CAR IS YOURS,

dr050419 -- slurp slurp slurrrp! My turn! - - - The old "crimp in the hose" trick claims another victim!
dr050420 -- Norman, don't you know how to hose-off the driveway?? - You need more water pressure! How do I get that? - stick your thumb in the nozzle! -
dr050421 -- Norm! I got a new spray nozzle for the hose! Now it'll be easier to take a drink! - Just put it on "Turbo Jet" and pull the trigger! OK! - This'll be sweet! - SPLADDLAPP!
dr050422 -- Oops! I forgot to roll up the windows! -
dr050423 -- Time to reel in the hose! crank crank crank . AAAARRRGH! -
dr050424 -- Crud! We'll never get on this ride! The line is too long! - If you don't want to wait in line, we can use a "Speedy Voucher." What's that? - It's a ticket that allows you to return at a later time when you won't have to wait! - Great! Let's
dr050424 -- try it! It's easy! I push the button, get our ticket, and see what time to come back! - - When does it say to come back? October 23rd at 9:52 PM!
dr050425 -- Paper or plastic? - Hmm...well, let's see... - This time I'll say...PAPER! - Sweet! I'm right again!! Make sure he pays in cash!
dr050426 -- Smile! - CLICK! - WAA HA HA!! - Look how smily he looks now! The only thing more obnoxious than mom with a camera is mom with a DIGITAL camera!
dr050427 -- I give up. I knew this day would come! - My eyes just aren't as sharp as they used to be! - Don't feel bad, dad...everyone eventually needs reading glasses! - ...or, in our case, picking-fleas-off-the-cat glasses!
dr050428 -- I can't stand it! It's too confusing!! - The newscaster is reading us one story, and there's another story running across the bottom of the screen! - I can't listen and read at the same time! I'm going crazy!! - Norman's just not a cable news

dr050504 -- mention that you're 19?
dr050505 -- *hic!* The best way to cure your hiccups is to frighten you! - So please forgive me for what I am about to do... - A picture of grandma? - Why would I be frightened by a picture of *hic* grandma? Always works for me!
dr050506 -- Here, Norm,,,try my mother's sure-fire hiccup cure! *hic* - Drink water from a straw while holding your nose and plugging your ears! - Why would I need to plug my ears? - Trust me.

dr050523 -- Hi! I'm Ralph Drabble! - This week, I'd like to step out of the comic strip and speak directly to you, the audience. - This is known as "breaking the fourth wall". - He broke it, all right!
dr050524 -- This week, I'd like to speak directly to all of the new readers of Drabble! - As you may know, we get new readers all the time... - And some of you may be a little confused. - So, I'd like to explain what's going on in our comic strip! Good
dr050524 -- luck! I've been in this strip all my life and I don't know what's going on!
dr050525 -- For you readers who may be new to our strip, let me tell you a little about myself... - I have an exciting, high-profile career in law enforcement! - I don't want to brag by telling you exactly what I do. Let's just say it's filled with
dr050525 -- glamour and intrigue. - He's a mall cop! DON'T HELP ME!
dr050526 -- Our new readers may be wondering about the duck... - His name is Bob, and he's not really a duck! He's a rare South American parrot that takes on the characteristics of a duck for survival in the jungle. - At least that's what my kids told
dr050526 -- me. - And it better be true because I hate ducks! On day, I hope to migrate to a different comic strip!
dr050527 -- How many readers do we have, dad? - Research shows we have between 23 and 24 million readers! - We have 23 MILLION to 24 MILLION READERS?? That's not what I said... - I said between 23 and 24 million! Trust me. It's closer to 23!
dr050528 -- This is one of our pets, Wally the Wiener dog! - Wally's legs are so short, when he runs, he never seems to get anywhere! skattle skattle skattle - Of course, we know that in actuality, Wiener dogs are very fast! Right, Wally? skattle skattle
dr050528 -- skattle If you say so! - They're also very smart! E=MC² skattle skattle
dr050529 -- The mail's here, mom! - Good! I need a break from housework! - - There's a special place in the nether regions reserved for people who put confetti in party invitations!
dr050530 -- shake shake Darn! I'm out of ink! - Norman, can I borrow a pencil? - Why, certainly! - Never borrow a pencil from Norman.
dr050531 -- Patrick, will you help me cram for finals? Sure. - Here, quiz me! - Economics. Wednesday at 8:30, in room 213! - Incorrect. It's Thursday at noon in room 621. Dang! Norman's idea of cramming for finals is making sure he knows where to go!
dr050601 -- Dad, you got a really important call while you were out! - I couldn't find a pen and paper, so I wrote it all down on my Etch-A-Sketch! - Unfortunately, a few minutes later, we had an earthquake and it all got erased. Sorry! - I have a whole
dr050601 -- different set of problems than most people!
dr050602 -- - - CREEEEEEEKK! - Looking for a midnight snack, Mr. Why-Can't-I-Lose-Weight? One of these days, I need to lube the pantry door!
dr050603 -- Be careful at the stop sign up ahead, dad! - Sometimes a policeman parks around the corner and nabs people who fail to come to a complete stop! - I don't see him. I guess he's not here, today! - Darn! I wasted a good stop!
dr050604 -- - My cell phone is ringing. beep! - Sorry. Wrong number! - How did you KNOW it was a...oh, yeah, who would ever call YOU? My ambition is to run out of minutes someday!
dr050605 -- COUGH! COUGH! HACK! COUGH! - Ralph! How ya' doin'?? Uh...hi, No-Neck! - What brings you to the doctor's office? Are you sick? No, I'm fine. My wife just made me come in for a check-up. - That's good. You don't want what I've got! I'm sick as
dr050605 -- a dog! - Hey, Fred! DO you know Ralph? No! Nice to...COUGH! ...meet you! - COUGH! HACK! WHEEZE! HACK! WHEEZE! COUGH! - I think you should go to the doctor.
dr050606 -- Sweet! There's one slice of pie left! - This is probably a stupid question, dad, but would you care to split it? - Norm, there's no such thing as a stupid question... - But that was a heck of a nice try!
dr050607 -- Ah ka uhnnathah waa kah nahah laa waah! - WHAT did you say?? Gulp! - I said, I can't understand why I can never lose weight! It's hard to talk with a mouthful of twinkie.
dr050608 -- Let's go on a diet together! - We'll have a contest to see who can lose the most weight! - Come on! Let's go weigh ourselves! OK, just a minute... - Ready! No fair loading your pockets with golf balls!
dr050609 -- - - munch munch munch - Dad, I'm glad you're on a diet, but I think you've been eating too much lettuce!
dr050610 -- What are YOU doing here?? - I'm guarding the refrigerator. - If you attempt to obtain a midnight snack, I have been instructed to quack loudly and alert the household! - I'll share. Brownies are behind the milk!
dr050611 -- Honeybunch, I have a bone to pick with you! - You hid my favorite candy! You put it in the far back of the pantry, down on the bottom shelf! - Didn't you trust me to stick to my diet?? Do you think that I'm so weak that I'd actually... - How
dr050611 -- do you KNOW I hid them? Uhhhhh...
dr050612 -- 45...46...47! - We have 48 items in our cart, and you only have 47... - So you can go ahead of us! Thank you! - I'm not taking you shopping anymore! I have lots of coupons!
dr050613 -- Mom and dad are having a contest to see who can lose the most weight! - She seems to be taking it more seriously than him! For your information, twelve hours of watching TV burns up as many calories as one hour of jogging!
dr050614 -- Stupid scale! It says I GAINED a pound! - How can that be?! I've been starving myself ever since we started our diet contest! - Maybe the scale is adjusted to high, honeybunch! - Nope, it says I've LOST three pounds!
dr050615 -- Dang it! I've gained another half a pound! - Last week I started a contest with Ralph to see who could lose the most weight. - And after all this time, what do I have to show for it?? - A skinny husband! flex flex!
dr050616 -- Ralph, I can't believe it! - How did you lose so much weight?! - I severely cut my donut intake! - I'm down to half a dozen per day!
dr050617 -- You should be HAPPY that I've lost weight, honeybunch! - I'm disappointed with myself! I've been eating celery for ten days, and I haven't lost an ounce! - Don't worry, honeybunch! Even though I'm now a fabulous hunk, I'll always continue to
dr050617 -- walk by your side. - For one thing, it's shady!
dr050618 -- I'm home! Ralph! What happened?? - You're FAT again!! - I know. That new buffet opened across town! - On the bright side, at least now I won't need to replace my entire wardrobe! Burp!
dr050619 -- Hey! Let's get this shirt for dad for Father's Day! World's #1 Dad - "World's Number One Dad"? Isn't that kind of unrealistic? - Why? Well, think about it... - There are more than 6 billion people in the world, so there must be at least a
dr050619 -- couple of billion dads! - Dad couldn't possibly be the world's number ONE dad! And he warned us never to exaggerate! - If he's not number one, where does he rank? Well, it's safe to say he's in the top billion... - Happy Father's Day! Thanks
dr050619 -- for the ringing endorsement, kids. World's 34,892,671 Dad It's a good thing you wear an "XXL"!
dr050620 -- Ticket Booth Five tickets please. I heard they opened a new thrill ride at this amusement park! - "The Dirigible Of Doom." It's so shocking, it's supposed to make your hair stand on end! - HOW much?? It can't be any more shocking than the
dr050620 -- ticket booth.
dr050621 -- It's a crowded day at the amusement park! - I can't tell if we're in Future Land, Wild West Land or Dinosaur Land! We're obviously in Future Land. - How can you tell? They've got a serious overpopulation problem!
dr050622 -- So far, all we've done at this amusement park is wait in lines! - I give up! You guys can wait in line! I'm going to sit down! - Great. There's even a line for the bench!
dr050623 -- I can't understand why dad dislikes amusement parks! I can't either! - He seems to fit right in! Quit following me around! I'm not a character!
dr050624 -- How come you're scared to go on the fast rides, dad? I'm not scared! - I already went on one fast ride today! Did you? Which one? - You know, that long, snake-like ride with all the people inside! - You mean the parking lot tram? Man, I
dr050624 -- thought I was gonna lose my lunch!
dr050625 -- Well, we're all tired, but we had a fun day at the amusement park! - It will feel good to get home and crawl in bed! - Assuming we ever remember where we parked the car! Don't worry, dad. I had the presence of mind to leave our lights on!
dr050626 -- Whoa...I don't feel so good! Maybe you should see a doctor! They have a first-aid station over by the castle! - Loony Land First Aid - I'd like to see the doctor! Sign in and wait your turn! - I'm sick! Sign in and wait your turn! - Mr.
dr050626 -- Jones, the doctor will see you now! That's me! - Hey, I was here first! How come he gets to go before me?? - I used my "Speedy Pass" ticket! Never get sick at an amusement park!
dr050627 -- WHOOSH WHOOSH - pant pant pant - whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh - Summer's going to be over in two months, you know! Maybe YOU'D like to blow up the pool!
dr050628 -- WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH - WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH - Done! wheeze pant pant pant wheeze wheeze pant I forgot to mention, you could've used a blow dryer!
dr050629 -- How was your baseball game, Patrick? - Great! I won the game with a "walk-off" double! Way to go! - I hit a "walk-off" double when I was in little league, too! - Yeah, but unfortunately, the game wasn't over when you walked off! No wonder the
dr050629 -- coach was so upset!
dr050630 -- DING DONG - Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf! - Relax, Wally! That was just the TV! - Jeepers! How dumb can you get? Why would a TV be ringing our doorbell?
dr050701 -- - - Wally, if you're going to jump off the diving board, you've got to commit to it!
dr050702 -- What flavor of dog food should I buy for Wally? - It doesn't matter. - Of course it matters! If he doesn't like it, he might not eat it! - How about the chicken with rice? Get something that tastes like my cushion insoles. He ate those
dr050702 -- yesterday!
dr050703 -- When we get home, remind me to check your father's pedometer! - What's a pedometer?? It's a little device that measures how far you walk! I bought it for him yesterday. - The doctor told him he needs to walk at least two miles a day in order
dr050703 -- to lose weight! I can't wait to see how far he's gone today! - OK, Ralph! Show me the pedometer! - - 3.46 miles! Good for you!! - All those trips to the refrigerator really add up!
dr050704 -- - - - Sometimes I think my kids just see me as a walking ATM!
dr050705 -- - poink! I'm free! - Hey guys! Wait for me! Losing one's hair can be a demoralizing experience!
dr050706 -- - One...two...three... - ABANDON HEAD! - My hairs are like rats deserting a sinking ship!
dr050707 -- June! It's so nice to see you again! What brings you to the little league fields? - My son Patrick! In fact, that's him batting against your son, Hunter! - Really?? What a coincidence! Excuse me for one moment... - STRIKE HIM OUT, HUNTER!!
dr050707 -- CLOBBER IT, PATRICK!!
dr050708 -- STRIKE HIM OUT, HUNTER! TAKE HIM DOWNTOWN, PATRICK!! - Strike three! YES! YES! YES! - 'bye, June! I'll see you at the book club next month! - Friendships that stand the test of time are nothing compared to friendships that stand the test of
dr050708 -- little league!
dr050709 -- You hate me, don't you? Of course not! - You're OK. I just don't find you particularly exciting or compelling. - But you're better than nothing. - Great. I'm the human equivalent of interleague baseball.
dr050710 -- Ralph! Ralph Drabble! Long time, no see! - Hey, how ya' doin? - Great, Ralph! What's new? Oh, nothing much, Bill! - How's the family, Ralph? The family is great, Frank! How about yours? - Just fine, Ralph! Thanks for asking! You're welcome,
dr050710 -- Jerry! - Well, it's nice to see you again, Ralph! Same here, Vinny! - Say hello to the missus, Ralph! Will do, Enrique! - Something tells me you couldn't remember his name! I hope it wasn't too obvious!
dr050711 -- - - You're being awfully quiet, Norman. - Sorry, I guess I... DON'T SPOIL IT!!!
dr050712 -- - Leonardo DiCaprio??? - Hello?? - Wendy answers her phone more often since I got "Fake Caller I.D."!
dr050713 -- No, don't hire painters, mother... - I'm sure Ralph would LOVE to paint your house! WHAT?! - SWERVE! - Not only is it dangerous to drive while talking on a cell phone, it's dangerous to drive while your WIFE is talking on a cell phone!
dr050714 -- You sure bought lots of stuff! Do we really NEED all this? - Are you implying that I'm a compulsive shopper?? - Not at all! - But, just out or curiosity, why did you by two canes? We're going to be old one day, and they were on sale!
dr050715 -- How was the movie? - According to the Ralph Drabble Rating System, it was a seven. - A seven is pretty good, right? No, a seven is terrible! - Your father judges a movie by how many times he gets up to go to the bathroom.
dr050716 -- I give up! I'm a weak man! - Ahh... Pork rinds! - So much for dad's "starvation" diet! That was the longest hour and 45 minutes of my life!
dr050717 -- ? - Next! ? - ? - Paper or plastic? - - Life is no picnic when you suffer from chronic indecisiveness. Actually, that's not true. Well, maybe it is!
dr050718 -- I got a big promotion at the mall! - After 15 distinguished years of fighting crime, I have been promoted to assistant supreme mall cop commander! - Wow! Does that mean you'll get a raise? Even better... - I get to wear a cape!
dr050719 -- Why do you wear a cape on the job, dad? - Watch how cool I look when I run. - - PANT WHEEZE PUFF HE looks cool until he stops running!
dr050720 -- Look! It's "Mall Cop Man"! - He's in a hurry! There must be an emergency in the mall! - Or else it's lunch-time and he's trying to beat the rush! First in line!
dr050721 -- How did you get to be "Mall Cop Man"? - I came to this mall to help ensure truth, justice and a top-notch shopping experience! - I achieves superhero status as a result of my heroic actions during the recent midnight madness sale! Wow! - If
dr050721 -- you don't write your own story, someone else will write it for you!
dr050722 -- Another day's work is done. - "Mall Cop Man" will now hop into the Mall Cop-Mobile and return to his secret lair! chirp! - O the road, an adoring public waves to express its appreciation! - Or maybe it's just because my cape is caught in the
dr050722 -- door!
dr050723 -- DING! - - DING! - Aakk! Mall cops wearing capes may not be a good idea!
dr050724 -- Here you go, No-Neck! BAP!  - BOP! - BAM! - That makes the score three to tone! Let's just play to five, I'm kind of pooped! Do you think "Fat Guy Beach Volleyball" will ever catch on? I hope not!
dr050725 -- By the way, last night on the news, they showed a beached whale being rolled back into the ocean. - I wonder what made you think of that? Beats me! You two are liable to be on the news, yourselves!
dr050726 -- I wonder why people always bring so much stuff to the beach? Beats me... - Ask dad! I hate to disturb him during "Raymond."
dr050727 -- Everyone needs sunscreen! - Whenever you're at the beach, it's important to protect your skin! - I'd say we're protected, mom! Better safe than sorry!
dr050728 -- You need more sunscreen! - What is it about mom that makes her want to put sunscreen on us all the time?? It's maternal instinct! - Moms have a natural inclination to protect everyone from getting sunburned. - ...whether she knows them or
dr050728 -- not! Hey, lady! Why are you putting sunscreen all over me?? Have you never heard of global warming?
dr050729 -- Who else at this beach needs sunscreen?! - How about you? NO, thank you, I don't like sunscreen! - Lady, I don't WANT any sunscreen!! Hold still! You'll thank me when you're old!! You might not believe this, but when I married your mom, she
dr050729 -- was fairly normal!
dr050730 -- Are you wearing two pairs of glasses?? Yes, reading glasses and sunglasses. - Why? Because I'm outside and I'm reading. - OK, but shouldn't you be wearing the sunglasses over the reading glasses? No. - Why? Because that would be stupid!
dr050731 -- This has been a test of the emergency broadcast system. - We repeat: this was only a test! Never mind! My mistake! Everybody, go back to bed!
dr050801 -- THIS IS YOUR FINAL WARNING! PULL OVER IMMEDIATELY! - LEADING ME ON A HIGH_SPEED PURSUIT WILL ONLY COMPOUND YOUR PROBLEMS! - How do I pull over on an escalator?? You should have thought of that before ignoring the "Please Use Handrail" sign!
dr050802 -- Look at the picture I drew, daddy! Wow, Penny! - What is it? It's a picture of a mommy, and a daddy! - Which one is which? The daddy is the one with earrings, and the mommy is the one with tattoos! - Duh! Times have changed since I was a kid!
dr050802 -- CONTINENTS have changed since you were a kid!
dr050803 -- ka-pock! pa-kop! - WHAM! - Next! We can beat dad at every video and computer game. Ping-pong is all he has left!
dr050804 -- Dad, I saw a new invention today that will revolutionize the communications industry! - On a street corner, I saw a booth with a TELEPHONE inside, that could be activated simply by dropping coins in a slot! - What a great idea! It's obvious
dr050804 -- for people who have forgotten their cell phones! - The future is now, isn't it, son! What an amazing time to be alive!
dr050805 -- I'm excited that you agreed to go out with me tonight, Wendy! - I thought it might be fun to go to the Minimart for a cherry slush, and then watch ourselves in the security monitor! - I need an Aspirin. Why? Do you have a migraine? - No, but
dr050805 -- the Aspirin takes half an hour to work, and by then, I probably will!
dr050806 -- - Ralph, why do you stand here and stare into the refrigerator all night long? - Don't exaggerate! I do not stare into the refrigerator all night long! - Just until icicles form on my nose!
dr050807 -- Wow! This dog food is really GOOD! I could get used to eating this! Mm-MMM!! - I've always wondered what dogs dream about when they're having nightmares! whimper whimper whimper!
dr050808 -- Munch munch munch - Hey, don't double-dip! That's unsanitary! - I didn't get enough dip on it! You need to dip your chip well enough to cover it the first time! - Like this!
dr050809 -- My hair is turning gray. - Gray hair runs in my family! - - In your case, it seems to be running away!
dr050810 -- Look! Another one of dad's hairs is about to fall out! - bink! - Very nice! - 9.5 10 Smart alecks!
dr050811 -- - What are you doing? We're watching dad's hair fall out! - There they go! bink bink bink boink! - It's kind of like watching lemmings! I'll be glad when school starts again!
dr050812 -- Ralph, I can't believe you ate all the chocolate dough! - That was selfish and inconsiderate! - If you ever do that again, you may or may not live to regret it! Sorry. - How did that go? Let's just say I got the last word!
dr050813 -- What's up with this stupid remote entry device?? - I hate modern technology!! How come it won't unlock the door?! It only unlocks the CAR door, Ralph! - Oh, yeah, huh! It's been a long day, hasn't it?
dr050814 -- - - - - - Poor dad. When we go to the amusement park, he never wants to go on any of the rides! I'm sure he finds ways to entertain himself while we're waiting in line!
dr050815 -- Wow!! This is AMAZING!! - Awesome! Spectacular! Breathtaking!! You mean, this is IT??
dr050816 -- Isn't Niagara Falls amazing?! For thousands of years, water has poured into the river below! - Just THINK about it! - How come the water never runs out? Why doesn't the river overflow? Can you imagine their monthly water bill? OK, OK...stop
dr050816 -- thinking about it!
dr050817 -- Isn't it exciting, Ralph?! - This boat will take us to get a close-up view of the falls! - WHAP - THAT'S CLOSE ENOUGH!!
dr050818 -- ...I'm telling you I can't sleep with all that noise! - There's nothing you can do about it?? - Then this is the last time I intend to stay at this hotel? Goodbye! - Honeybunch, they can't turn off Niagara Falls at night! I don't expect them
dr050818 -- to turn it off, just down a little!
dr050819 -- We're coming to the border checkpoint... - The officer will have to ask us a number of questions before we can return to our country. No need to be nervous or intimidated! Just answer the questions calmly! - State your country of citizenship.
dr050819 -- Haaminna haaminna haminna...
dr050820 -- What was the purpose of your vacation, Mr. Drabble? - We just wanted to see Niagara Falls from the other side! Honest! - Are you carrying any weapons in your car? Absolutely not! - What's about that thing in the trunk, dad? It's just a
dr050820 -- crowbar! Step out of the vehicle, please.
dr050821 -- I love the buffet! - booble-oodle-oop! - Hello? - Hi, Ralph! Will you please pick me up a slice of cantaloupe and a blueberry muffin while you're up? - - Thank you, Ralph. Have I mentioned lately that I hate cell phones?
dr050822 -- The key to a successful visit to New York City is not to look like tourists! - So I went out and bought some things that will help us look like native New Yorkers! - Are you sure native New Yorkers wear statue of liberty hats? Trust me! We'll
dr050822 -- blend right in!
dr050823 -- Excuse me...where can we catch the subway? - Down those steps. Really? - Wow! Who would've guessed it was underground?? We might have waited on that street corner all day!
dr050824 -- What a fun we had in New York city! - Tomorrow should be even more fun! Good night, Ralph! click! - - Still thinking about your first New York city cab ride? Has the car stopped yet?
dr050825 -- knock knock knock Yes? Mail for Norman Drabble. - Mail for ME?? Thank you, my good man! - "Dear Norman, I'm having a wonderful time on your vacation. Don't hurry back. Regards, Wendy." - How thoughtful! Norman's the only person I know who
dr050825 -- GETS post cards on vacation!
dr050826 -- Hey, the light isn't green yet, but everyone is crossing the street! - Pedestrians don't always wait for green lights in New York city! - Is that so? Well, it's a good thing Ralph Drabble is in town! - CITIZEN'S ARREST!
dr050827 -- Kids, this is the Empire State Building! - This is the building that King Kong climbed! - Did King Kong REALLY climb up this building? Of course not, Penny. It was just a movie! - I'm sure it was a stunt monkey!
dr050828 -- Oh, boy! Cookies!! Better not, dad. Mom warned us not to have any before dinner! - Yeah, if she notices any missing, we might get in trouble! - Relax, boys. Watch and learn from the master! - You'll notice these cookies come in a plastic tray,
dr050828 -- in three rows. There are already a few cookies missing. - Now, if we take one cookie, it will be obvious. If we take two cookies, it will be obvious... - But, if we take one cookie from each row, we'll have THREE cookies, and no one will
dr050828 -- notice the difference! Wow! - How did dad get to be so smart? Apparently, the same way he got to be so fat!
dr050829 -- Airport terminals are fun! Yeah...the only thing I don't like about them is that it means we will soon be thousands of feet in the sky with nothing holding us up! - Your father is not an enthusiastic flyer! And why do they have to call then
dr050829 -- TERMINALS?!
dr050830 -- Look out the window, kids! It's the mighty Mississippi! - Principal river of the United States! 2.348 miles of water on an unstoppable journey th the Gulf of Mexico! - Isn't it an amazing sight? - Actually, dad, that's just a crack on the
dr050830 -- asphalt. We haven't taken off, yet! Well, excuse me, Mr. Know-It-All!
dr050831 -- There's not much leg room, is there? - Maybe you'd be more comfortable if you reclined your seat! - These seats recline?? - Sweet!
dr050901 -- Wow! There it is! The Grand Canyon!! - Nature's masterpiece! What a sight to behold! - All right, you've seen it! Now will you please go back to your own seat?! - I hope I never become as jaded as you people!
dr050902 -- It's good to be home! - I can't wait to sleep in my own bed! - What a vacation! I'm exhausted! - You know you had a good vacation when you come home and feel like you need another vacation!
dr050903 -- Come on, Ralph! We're going to watch the videos you took of our vacation! - Whoa! I'm getting dizzy! I don't remember there being an earthquake in New York! Next vacation, YOU GUYS can shoot the videos!
dr050904 -- Come on, Penny! We're all going out for Chinese food! Why! - Because mommy likes Chinese food, so we're all going to the restaurant! Why! - Because we're a family, and you're part of our family, and you're going to come with us! Why? - Penny,
dr050904 -- you need to think more of others and less about yourself! Why? - Because you shouldn't be selfish! - Think of it this way: There is no "I" in "Penny". - No, but there's a "Y"!
dr050905 -- Hello, telethon? May I speak to Jerry, please? - Busy??! He's not busy! I can see him on TV! He's just sitting at his desk listening to some guy sing! - Just tell him Ralph Drabble is on the phone! I'm his biggest fan! I wrote him a letter in
dr050905 -- 1967! - I'm sure he'll  remember me!
dr050906 -- Wow! There's a cute new girl working at the yogurt shop! Here's my chance to make a good first impression! - What can I get for you? - You're pointing to the Dutch chocolate? OK! - Maybe I'll be able to make a good second impression!
dr050907 -- There's a cute new girl working at the yogurt shop! I'll impress her by putting a dollar in her tip jar! - Crud! She didn't see me do it! NOW what should I do?? - Do nothing! Anonymous gifts are the most generous gifts of all! I say reach
dr050907 -- into the jar, pull out the dollar, and give it to her again when she's looking! - How come I always like the "Dumb Norm's" ideas better?
dr050908 -- Darn! She didn't see me put a tip in her jar! Now she'll think I'm a cheapskate! - Maybe I could reach in, pull out the tip, and put it back in when she IS looking! - Great idea! - Bad idea! Now my hand is stuck!
dr050909 -- Yikes! I've got my hand stuck in the tip jar!! - - Did you say you wanted Dutch chocolate or milk chocolate? D...D...Dutch chocolate! - Oh yeah. Why do thinks like this always happen to such an intelligent guy like me??
dr050910 -- I can't believe I got my hand stuck in her tip jar! - I've got to get it off before she sees me! - Here you go! Did I ask for a medium? I meant to say I wanted a large! - No problem. I'll start over! Take your time!!
dr050911 -- Good morning, dad! Mornin', Norm! - I think I'll go out and look for a job today! - But, before I go, I'll make sure to mow the lawn and wash your car! - And after that, I'll clean my room, wash the dishes, and... - EVERYBODY TAKE COVER!!! -
dr050911 -- RRRUMMMBBLE sway sway sway sway - How did you KNOW there was about to be an earthquake?? Norman started acting strangely!
dr050912 -- How did he get his hand stuck in the girl's tip jar? He took my advice and reached in to get his dollar back, so he can put it back in when she's looking! - FOOMP! - What a bonehead! Dang! I forgot to get the dollar! Reach in again!
dr050913 -- I need to get my dollar back out of the tip jar so she can see me give it to her! - Uhhh...could you add a little blueberry, please? OK. - - Here you go! And here's a tip for you! THAT'S THE SNEAKIEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN!

dr051129 -- It's a good thing Zorro's name begins with a "Z". - If it started with a "B" or something, it would take longer to carve his initial into the bad guy's pants! Eat your popcorn, Norman.
dr051130 -- Thanks for the call! - That was Wendy. She wanted to let me know she couldn't go out with me on new year's eve! - You already asked her? No. - That's what I love about her. She's so thoughtful!

dr051211 -- to make you happy! - I'd rather not have any presents at all than to see you upset! - I know I gave you a long Christmas list, but please don't buy me another thing! Whatever you got for me so far is enough, OK? - Thank you, Penny! I feel
dr051211 -- better already! Good! - Besides, Santa will bring me all the other stuff! He always does!
dr051212 -- Why is there a Poker game on the SPORTS channel?? - Poker isn't a sport! - I don't consider something a sport unless it makes me sweaty! - In that case, bending over to tie your shoes is a sport!
dr051213 -- How about this one? - Nope. Why not?? - It's too short, too wide, and has a big bald spot! - I like it! Probably because it reminds you of you!
dr051214 -- Excuse me, ma'am,,,I overheard you grumbling about the crowds here at the mall. - I'm afraid I'll have to issue you a holiday spirit violation! - HOLIDAY SPIRIT VIOLATION??! Part of the joy of the season is being together with other members

dr051219 -- - rip rip shred rip! - - Apparently, "holiday spirit violations" are unenforceable at home!
dr051220 -- I wrapped dad's present! - Norman, you should have DISGUISED it! - He'll know it's a bowling ball! - It's a pair of golf shoes. In that case, good job!
dr051221 -- Hey, I recognize this... - It's the fruitcake that the Herreras gave us! - We gave it to the Loys who must have given it to the Edwards, who have given it back to us! - Boy, we have cheap friends! Fruitcake: the gift that keeps on being
dr051221 -- given!
dr051222 -- This fruitcake gets passed around the neighborhood every year because nobody wants it! - Well, now it's the Mitchell's problem! DING DONG - I'm rid of it for another year! -

dr060203 -- Nothing is quite as intimidating as calling a girl to ask for a date! - She's not answering. That's OK. Sometimes it's easier just to leave a message! - Hi, this is Wendy. Leave your name and number and I'll call you back. If this is Norman
dr060203 -- calling, no I don't want to go out with you! - ...and sometimes it's not.
dr060204 -- Are you going to call Wendy and ask for a date again? - Nope, I'm too chicken! - Asking a girl can be extremely intimidating! - That must be why they call it "dating".

dr060530 -- ...sigh...every night, he falls asleep watching TV! Z - Why does he DO that? Why doesn't he go to BED and fall asleep?! - IT drives me crazy!! - RALPH! WAKE UP AND GO TO SLEEP!!
dr060531 -- Ralph, why on earth do you like to fall asleep in front of the TV every night?? - It's a "guy" thing, honeybunch! - Falling asleep in front of the TV is one of those things that all men enjoy and women don't fully appreciate. - That, and
dr060531 -- Larry the cable guy!
dr060601 -- Honeybunch, drifting off to sleep while sitting in front of the TV is one of the great joys in life! - It also makes me smarter! - After I fall asleep, my subconscious mind absorbs and remembers everything on TV! - At least, I ASSUME that's
dr060601 -- why I know the price of every used car in town!
dr060602 -- Ralph, it's ridiculous that you fall asleep watching old war movies every night! - Fall asleep in your bed, where it's peaceful and quiet! - I cant's believe I have to wake you up to tell you to go to bed! Maybe you have some sort of medical
dr060602 -- condition. You ought to go see a doctor. Are you wearing a nasal strip? If you start snoring tonight you'll wake me up and I won't be able to get back to sleep! Then I'll be crabby all day tomorrow. I sure hope the neighbor's dog won't start
dr060602 -- barking at three like it did last night. I don't know why they don't take it inside at night! ...trash cans... The war movie was quieter!
dr060603 -- - CLICK! - Sweet! A full tank of gas and it only cost me $20! - Gas prices don't seem so traumatic when you fill it up every fifty miles!
dr060605 -- So, what restaurant do you want to go to, honeybunch? I've narrowed it down to Aldo's or Chauncy's. you decide! - No, YOU decide! I insist you pick! I'll be happy at either one! - Well, OK. Then let's go to...Chauncy's! Fine! - Let's just hope
dr060605 -- their service has improved!
dr060606 -- Isn't it nice that we could go out for a pleasant evening together, Ralph? - No worries, no stress... - IF THAT KID BEHIND ME DOESN'T STOP KICKING MY SEAT, THERE ARE GOING TO BE SOME SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES! - Think that got their attention? I
dr060606 -- think it got EVERYONE'S attention!
dr060607 -- Excuse me! We're still waiting for our bread! - I'll tell your waitress. - Don't bother telling her! Just bring us our bread!! - I would, but I don't work here! Isn't anyone in this restaurant willing to take some responsibility?
dr060608 -- How is everything? - The soup was cold, the chicken is overcooked, there are spots on my silverware, it's freezing in here, and I need a refill! - How's everything with you? Great! - Did I say "great"?? I meant to say "totally unacceptable"!
dr060609 -- Hello. I'm Valerie. I'll be your new waitress. - What happened to our other waitress? - She quit. - Was I really being that difficult? Not until you complained about the flavor of the salt.
dr060610 -- I'm sorry if I ruined dinner, Ralph. - I made you pick the restaurant, and then I complained about everything! That's OK, honeybunch! - Let's go see a movie and forget about it! OK! - You pick which one! NO!

dr060613 -- Welcome home, dad! - How was your day on the golf course? - Never mind! When he comes back with no clubs left in his bag, it wasn't a good day!
dr060614 -- I'm not sure I want to work at Galtburger after all! - Their job application is insane! - Look, they want you to write your LAST name FIRST, your FIRST name in the middle, and your MIDDLE name LAST! - Maybe they just want to see how well I
dr060614 -- follow complicated instructions!
dr060615 -- This job application sure asks a lot of questions! - "Wage desired"? - Hmmm... - I'll put "yes."
dr060616 -- Hello? ...yes, this is Norman Drabble! - Galtburger calling? ...you want to give me a job?? REALLY??? - Are you sure?? You want ME to WORK for you?? Aren't you afraid I'll make a complete MESS of everything?? - I knew that was too good to be
dr060616 -- true! Way to blow your own horn, son!
dr060617 -- Dad, watch! I've been trying for years, and I can finally do it! - I can rub my head and pat my stomach! Wow, that's great, Norm! - Except you're supposed to rub your STOMACH and pat your HEAD! - Eight years of practice down the drain! Sorry
dr060617 -- to be the one to break the news!
dr060619 -- Dad, I know you asked me to find a summer job... - But I think I'd rather just hang around and play video games! Son, I'm not asking you to go to work... - I'M FORCING YOU TO GO TO WORK!! - Now I know why they call it the "Work Force".
dr060620 -- Welcome to YIPEE YOGURT! I'm new here, and you're my first customer! - How nice! I'd like a small chocolate, please! - One small chocolate, coming up! - Did I mention that I'm new here?
dr060621 -- I'll have a medium vanilla and chocolate and swirl it, please! - "Swirl" it? -  -How's that?
dr060622 -- I'll have a large strawberry yogurt, please! - Large? Uh...OK... - - We're out of large cups!
dr060623 -- I want a medium-sized yogurt, prepared to my exact specifications. - Strawberry on the bottom, then vanilla and chocolate side by side, then peanut butter on top of that... - Then a little bit of peach, a dash of blueberry, and a dollop of
dr060623 -- mint! Now, for the toppings... - Why aren't you still at work? I panicked and ran home!
dr060624 -- ...and here's your change! - - - If that tip jar were a snake, it would have bit you!
dr060626 -- Ralph, I'd like to congratulate you on the improvements you've made to your home! - It's never looked better! - That's a fumigation tent! Like I said...
dr060627 -- A TIP JAR??? Why should I give you a tip?? - Did you do anything beyond what you're paid to do?? - Now you want even MORE money?? You should be ashamed! - "Tips" spelled backward is "spit."
dr060628 -- Don't act like such a doofus. - RIP! - FOLD FOLD - Thank you! No problem!
dr060629 -- How would you like me to cook your burger, Norm? Well done! - Well done?? I thought you liked your burgers rare! I do. - "Well done" is as close to as "rare" as dad gets! Honeybunch, how would you like your burger...well done, charred, or
dr060629 -- incinerated?
dr060630 -- Dinner's ready! - Hamburgers and hot dogs grilled beyond perfection! - They're beyond perfection, all right! Which are which? Wow! Beyond perfection and beyond recognition!
dr060701 -- Dum-diddle-um diddle-iddle-iddle-um - BONANZA - Dum.diddle-um, diddle-iddle-iddle-um, dum-diddle-um-dum-dum! - You know, dad, you're allowed to have more than one song on your iPod! It's the only one I need!
dr060703 -- Ralph, what's wrong?? I threw out my back! - DARN! That means you'll stay home from work today, and I won't get anything done around the house!! - My day is RUINED!! - You better get well soon, buster!! Florence Nightingale, she's not!
dr060704 -- There's nothing worse than missing work because of a bad back! - Will you kids knock it off?!! Don't make me come in there!! - I have housework to do! - As I was saying...
dr060705 -- - - SPLOOSH! People with bad backs shouldn't stand near pools!
dr060706 -- - Patrick! Don't make faces at your father! - I'm not! I'm just looking at my reflection in his bald spot! Sweet! That's it. Time to see a doctor.
dr060707 -- Dad, I think we need to get you to the doctor. - How on earth am I going to get to the doctor?? I can't even get in the car!! No problem... - Mr. Steinbauer loaned us his pick-up truck!
dr060708 -- Where's dad? Norman drove him to the doctor. - He threw out his back and couldn't stand up straight! - The only way to drive him was to lay him down gently in the back of a pick-up truck! - Sorry, I took that speed bump a little fast!
dr060710 -- Medical Care I need to see the doctor. I threw out my back! Take a seat, Mr. Drabble! - Take a seat== How am I supposed to do that?! - Don't worry, dad! I'll help you... - voila!
dr060711 -- Hello, Doc. No need to bow, Mr. Drabble! - I may be a doctor, but I'm still a human being just like you! - Well, hopefully not JUST like you! Hee hee hee ha ha! - Hardee har har. Patient displays irritability.
dr060712 -- Medical Care Can you help me, doc? I threw out my back and I can't straighten up! - Can't straighten up, eh? Let me ask you this... - Can you reach all the way back and remove the wallet from your back pocket? - Yes. I think we can help you!
dr060713 -- I hope the doctor can help daddy's bad back! Don't worry, Penny... - Modern medicine is amazing! Doctors have all sorts of technological advances at their fingertips! - Get the donut, Mr. Drabble! Almost there! Reach! Aarrrggh
dr060714 -- There's a long drive. It's going... It's going... - It's GONE!! HOME RUN!! WE WIN!! WE WIN!!! - Imagine how that poor pitcher feels. That's so sad. - And how in the world will they get out those grass stains? Let's never take her to a hockey
dr060714 -- game.
dr060715 -- Wow! I just thought of a great idea for a song! - I better write it down before I forget! - La da dee da da dum dum deedle dee - Too bad I can't write music!
dr060717 -- Here you go, ma'am! One small chocolate! I asked for DUTCH chocolate! - Oh, sorry! I'll start over! - It's a shame you have to throw away the rejects. - Trust me, nothing goes to waste!
dr060718 -- Dad, I'm a high school graduate... click click click click - I have a driver's license, I'm a registered voter... - I'm legally considered an adult. click click click click - When will you let me use the TV clickers?! Control of the clickers
dr060718 -- is an honor reserved for the head of the household!
dr060719 -- Mom, dad never lets me use the TV clicker! click click click click - He says it's an honor reserved for the head of the household! - He's right, Norman... - So, let's see what else is on! click click click HEY!
dr060720 -- click click click click - - My clicker feel suspiciously warm! Busted!
dr060721 -- - Whoa! Here comes the big one!! - - Out-of-shape guys like me should never put vibrating cell phones in our shirt pockets!
dr060722 -- Hold still... - For crying out loud! How much more sunscreen do I need?? - Be patient, Ralph! I'm Norman!
dr060724 -- Why don't you like Mr. Steinbauer, Dad? - It goes way back... - In fact it goes back so far, I forget why I don't like him. - BUT I KNOW I DON'T! Dad's halfway to being able to forgive and forget!
dr060725 -- Hey, Ralph! What is it, Steinbauer? - I'm having a backyard pool party tonight! Everyone in the neighborhood is invited! - Well, everyone except you. I had to draw the line somewhere! - I suddenly remember why I don't like him! By the way,
dr060725 -- can I borrow some oil for my tiki torches?
dr060726 -- How DARE Steinbauer throw a pool party and not invite me! - Well, I intend to get even! Now, Ralph, you must act like an adult! - Trust me. I will handle this in a mature fashion! - I'm going to T.P. his house!
dr060727 -- The last light has gone out in the Steinbauer home! Time to T.P.! - Box, this takes me back! - I can barely remember the last time I T.P'd a house! - I couldn't have been more than 37 or 38!
dr060728 -- Steinbauer's house never looked better! - Whoa, I'm exhausted! - I should make a mental note for next time... - To T.P. a 2,000-square foot house, four dozen rolls is plenty!
dr060729 -- I'll fling one more roll at Steinbauer's house, and call it a night! - Ahem... - - You know you've got a tough cop when he's wearing sunglasses at two A.M.!
dr060731 -- Why, good evening, officer! You're probably wondering why I'm flinging bathroom tissue at that house! - You see, the man who lives there hosted a pool party earlier tonight... - And I'm the only one in the neighborhood who wasn't invited! -
dr060731 -- Gosh, it's hard to believe someone wouldn't invite a guy like you to a party! My thoughts exactly!!
dr060801 -- Officer, I look it looks bad for a grown man to be toilet-papering a house... - But the man who lives there, Mr. Steinbauer, is a very difficult person! - You're "teepee-ing" STEINBAUER'S house??? - Why didn't you just SAY so?! I take it
dr060801 -- you're familiar with him!
dr060802 -- The sun up! I can't wait to see Steinbauer's house! - It must be foggy outside! I can't see a thing!  - Oh no... - I TEEPEED MY OWN HOUSE!!
dr060803 -- You teepeed your own house?? Why in the world did you do THAT, dad?? - It was dark! It was late! I was half asleep!! - Gosh, this is something I would do! Now THAT hurts!
dr060804 -- Someone teepeed your house, eh, Drabble? Who would do such a thing?? - Ah, there's a clue: This paper is a single-ply, generic brand! - Whoever did this is obviously a cheapskate! - I'd say you teepeed your own home, but even YOU aren't THAT
dr060804 -- stupid!
dr060805 -- I can't believe your father teepeed our own house last night! - That's the stupidest thing he's ever done! - Although re-rolling the paper is a close second! "Waste not, want not" I always say!
dr060807 -- It's not fair! - I've been eating right! I've been exercising! How come I'm still fat?! - This new diet isn't working!! - You've only been on it for 45 minutes! I'll give it another half hour, and then I'm ordering a pizza!
dr060808 -- Something wrong, dad? My birthday is in a few days and I'm dreading it! - There's nothing to dread about having a birthday! - You should know that! - You've had a million of 'em!
dr060809 -- Ralph, the credit card bills will be arriving any day... - Now, remember, you've got a birthday coming up, and I may have bought you a gift or two! - So, when the bills arrive, don't look at them... - Just pay them!
dr060810 -- Good morning, dad. On behalf of the entire family, I'd like to wish you a pleasant birthday. - That was pretty unenthusiastic! At your age, the less excitement, the better. Here's a balloon. We didn't blow it up 'cause it might pop!
dr060811 -- Bring in dad's birthday cake, Patrick! - You baked me a cake?? Well, not exactly... - We made a cake out of donuts! One for each year of your life! - Wow! We emptied out three donut shops!
dr060812 -- Oh, boy! Another can of Slim-Fast! - That makes three! One from Norman, one from Patrick, and one from Penny! - Great minds think alike, huh, dad? - I guess it's better than last year when they all gave me nose hair trimmers!
dr060814 -- I saved your best birthday gift for last, Ralph! - Tickets for you and me to see Barry Manilow in Las Vegas!! - - I'm so excited! I'll go pack! Is this MY birthday or YOURS??
dr060815 -- So, here we are, driving for hours through the blistering desert. - Because, for MY birthday, you gave me tickets to see YOUR favorite singer perform in Las Vegas. - This is payback for your Valentine's gift, isn't it, honeybunch? Nonsense!
dr060815 -- What woman wouldn't love to receive a variable speed jigsaw?!
dr060816 -- I'm so excited to be driving to Las Vegas to see Barry Manilow! - The first time we saw him in concert was on our first date, 25 years ago! You proposed to me after he sang "Mandy"! - We've seen Barry Manilow in concert before?? - GIVE ME A
dr060816 -- BREAK! MY MEMORY ISN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE!!
dr060817 -- You can get back in the car, Ralph. - Just because you couldn't remember our first date when we saw Barry Manilow and you proposed to me, I shouldn't have driven off and left you in the desert. - So I decided to pull over because I forgive
dr060817 -- you! - And also because we're out of gas! rrrrrr...
dr060818 -- Here's your light stick, Ralph! What's that for? - The concert! When Barry sings "Copacabana", everyone in the audience stands up, waves their light stick, and dances! - Have a good time, honeybunch! Ralph, get back in the car!!
dr060819 -- Our hotel room is pretty nice! - Look! We have a view of a hotel that has a view of the Las Vegas strip! - rrummble rrummble clankity clank clank clank clank clank! - And, apparently, we're very close to the ice machines! That's convenient. I
dr060819 -- can go get ice in my underwear.
dr060821 -- Honeybunch, before we go see the Barry Manilow concert, I'm going to visit the casinos. - It's probably best if you stay here in the room. - I'll be doing some serious high-stakes wagering, and it's not for the faint of heart! I understand! -
dr060821 -- You forgot your roll of nickels! Oh yeah...thank you!
dr060822 -- You're not going to wear that out in public, are you? Why not? - It's immodest! - Just because we're in Las Vegas, doesn't mean you should dress like a showgirl! - I think my strapless apron looks nice!
dr060823 -- Slots - - ...sigh... - The ice machine is as close as I ever come to hitting a jackpot in Vegas! clankity clank clank clank clank clank
dr060824 -- Manilow Concert I'll make a bet with you that my seat is directly behind that big guy's. - You win! If only I was this good at the blackjack table!
dr060825 -- At the Copa... - Copacabana.. - - Please tell me you didn't just throw your apron at Barry's feet! sorry. I got carried away!
dr060826 -- Hi, Norman! I'm just calling to tell you we're leaving Las Vegas and we're on our way home! - Yes, the concert was great! - I think your father even liked it!
dr060828 -- Hey, honeybunch! How about something to drink?! - - I meant in a glass!
dr060829 -- - I've decided to join the circus! - CRASH * bounce bounce * OW! * Jerque du Soleil!
dr060830 -- Only one more week until school starts again! Aww! I know! I's going to be lonely around here! - I'm going to miss you! What will I do all day long?! - Meryl Streep, eat your heart out!
dr060831 -- Here's a good one... - "What kind of dog tells time?" "A WATCH dog!" - HAR HAR HAR HAR! - I'll tell that one Tuesday morning! Can't YOU drive my school carpool this year, mom?
dr060901 -- When Norman was born, I knew it was going to be fun watching him grow up. - I just never knew it was going to take so long! bang bang bong!
dr060902 -- Wally, SIT! - skattle skattle skattle - - I see dad's been training the dog!
dr060904 -- Hello, this is Ralph Drabble! May I speak to Jerry, please? - Every year, I call the telethon and ask to speak to Jerry, but they never... - Hello? Ahhhhh...waaaaaa...haaaaa... - Well, nice to talk to you! I've got to go, now. Wayne Newton is
dr060904 -- almost done with his song! 'bye! You forgot to mention how much we liked "Cinderella"!
dr060905 -- Here's another good one: "What is Dracula's favorite place in New York?" - "The Vamipre State Building!" - "What is a mummy's favorite kind of music?" "Wrap!" - Boy, I could read these all night! SUPERMAN, WHERE ARE YOU?!
dr060906 -- You kids are sitting awfully close to the TV! - When I was a kid, mom told me not to sto too close to the TV because the rays would make my hair fall out! - You should have listened!
dr060907 -- - SNIFFFFF! - AAAAKK! cough cough cough! HACK! COUGH COUGH!! - Whoever said "stop and smell the dandelions" was out of his mind! I think they said "roses".
dr060908 -- Oowww! I told you if you ate your ice cream too fast, you'd get a headache! - I'm the voice of experience! Why don't you kids ever listen to me?? - We parents may not be as smart as we think we are... - But we're not as dumb as our KIDS think
dr060908 -- we are!
dr060909 -- - Here's your pen back, dad! - - Before you try to put a ballpoint pen in someone's pocket, make sure the point is retracted!
dr060911 -- Sorry, Bob. Summer is over! - Time to empty the wading pool! - This is why I migrate every year!
dr060912 -- - - It looks to me like Victoria doesn't HAVE many secrets!
dr060913 -- - kick! - - kick! kick! kick! - - IT'S FALL!
dr060914 -- Wendy, would you like to go out for dinner with me tonight? - Norman, whenever you ask me out, I have a conflict between my head and my heart! - My head says, "no way!" - But my heart says, "absolutely not a chance in heck!" Does your stomach
dr060914 -- have an opinion?
dr060915 -- MALL Excuse me, officer... - Where is a store called "Things Remembered"? - I forget. - I've been waiting ten years for somebody to ask me that!
dr060916 -- - Hello, Bob! - Quack, eh? - He's been hanging out with these Canadian geese, again!
dr060918 -- Here's our room! My friends Leonard and Stu talked me into taking a drawing class! - Gee, I wonder if I'll discover that I have a hidden talent? Probably! If you have any talent, Norman, it's hidden!
dr060919 -- Leonard, Stu...I don't know why I let you guys talk me into taking a DRAWING class! - I'm already pretty good at drawing! - You couldn't draw a bath! - SLAP! Nerds always like to high-five each other after witty remarks!
dr060920 -- Leonard, tell me again why we all signed-up for a drawing class! - To expand our horizons, acquire an appreciation for the arts, and develop skills we never knew we had! - - ...that, and the nude models. WHAT??
dr060921 -- Did you say something about NUDE MODELS?? - Yeah, the teacher said we were going to be sketching a model in the nude. - That means the model won't have any clothes on. OH, WHAT A RELIEF!! - I thought he meant WE wouldn't have any clothes on!
dr060922 -- We have to draw a NUDE MODEL??! I don't think I could DO that!! I'd be too uncomfortable! - I can't do it! I can't do it!! Norman, pull yourself together! - Yeah, this is ART! We must conduct ourselves with dignity and maturity! - In fact, to
dr060922 -- show how mature we are, let's move to the front row! NO!
dr060923 -- Uhhh...Norman? You're right, Stu! We have to be mature about this! - Norman? We shouldn't act like nerds! - We have to...what is it, Leonard? I think our model has arrived... - And look who it is!
dr060925 -- Sorry I'm late, professor! Class, I'd like you to meet... - HALT THE PROCEEDINGS!! - Wendy, I beg you not to do this! - Why not? It's art, isn't it? I want every man in here to close his eyes! Especially Leonard and Stu!!
dr060926 -- Wendy, I appreciate your dedication to the arts, but I beg you not to remove your clothes! - I'd be too uncomfortable! - Mr, Drabble, Wendy isn't here to model! She's a student in the class, just like you! - Please don't say I'm just like
dr060926 -- him! Sorry. Uh-oh...my contact lenses have already fogged-up!
dr060927 -- I'm not here to be a nude model!! I'm here to take the class!! - We don't HAVE nude models in this class, Mr. Drabble! - Where on earth did you get an idea like that?? Well, I, uhh... - *
dr060928 -- Mr. Drabble, don't worry! We do not draw nude models in this class! - The only thing we're going to draw today is this bowl of fruit! - Hey, where is it??! -
dr060929 -- Why did you guys tell me there would be nude models in our drawing class?! - I nearly made a complete fool of myself! - That's not true at all, Norman! - You DID make a complete fool of yourself! Yeah, what do you mean, "nearly"?
dr060930 -- Z - It's that time of year, again. Z - The lazy days of summer have turned into the lazy days of fall! Z
dr061002 -- Dad has a tan line! He needs to wear smaller socks! - And a larger shirt!
dr061003 -- Maybe I should by a laptop. - I'm not sure a laptop is for you, dad. - Why not? - For one thing, you'd need a lap!
dr061004 -- I'm considering putting my personal profile on this teen web site! - Aren't you concerned that someone might try to steal your identity? - MY identity?? - Good point. You mean there's a bigger loser than ME out there??
dr061005 -- Norm, I really don't think you should put your personal profile on that teen web site! - You might regret it! Some kids end up looking pretty foolish! - What if a prospective employer saw it? - Shouldn't be a problem! Oh, yeah...you'd have to
dr061005 -- apply for a job first!
dr061006 -- What are you doing? If you hold up your putter like this, it helps you line up your putt! - Never works for me!
dr061007 -- How was your golf game, Ralph? I broke 100! - Unfortunately, he broke it at the 15th hole!
dr061009 -- Well, I think I'll sit outside and enjoy the colors of autumn! - munch munch munch! Dad's idea of enjoying the colors of autumn is scarfing a bag of Reese's Pieces!
dr061010 -- Have a good soccer game, Patrick! Here, Ralph! - It*'s a referee shirt and whistle. Good luck! I have to REV?! Why ME???! - Youth soccer is strictly volunteer! Every parent has to take turns! - It's your day! Something tells me today is NOT
dr061010 -- going to be my day!
dr061011 -- TWEET! - OFFSIDES! - First down! Jump ball! Two-to-make-one! - You don't know anything about soccer, do you, ref! Uh-oh...they're on to me!
dr061012 -- TWEET! Aw, come on, ref! - That's the worst call I've ever seen! You're terrible! - KICK! - I'd have given you a yellow card, I couldn't find one!
dr061013 -- Great game, Varmints! Come get your snacks! - Hey, where did all the snacks go??! I got hungry at halftime.
dr061014 -- Gosh, I love living here! - Aren't you going to sweep up your crumbs, dad? I figure that's what ants are for!
dr061016 -- I know what your problem is, Norman... - You're in denial! - No, I'm not! - See?
dr061017 -- They're passing a law making it illegal to drive while talking on a cell phone. - Well, it's about time! - It's hard enough to drive while shaving and eating breakfast!
dr061018 -- Farmer Fred's Pumpkin Patch! My favorite October tradition! - Not mine! I have bad memories of this place! - I know, Ralph, but you need to let that go! Easy for you to say! - Farmer Fred never accused YOU of trying to steal a pumpkin under
dr061018 -- your shirt! Easy mistake.
dr061019 -- We've come to Farmer Fred's Pumpkin Patch every October since I was a little kid! - I'll never forget the time years ago, when dad hid behind the scarecrow and yelled "boo!" - I was so scared, I began hyperventilating, and mom made me
dr061019 -- breathe into a paper sack! - Actually, Norm, that was LAST year. I had nightmares until labor day!
dr061020 -- That'll be $12.50! - $12.50?!! How can you charge that much for a pumpkin??! - It's really big! Fine! - And just so you won't ask me again this year-no, I do not have a pumpkin under my shirt. See?!! - Good, 'cause that would've cost a
dr061020 -- fortune!
dr061021 -- Several bags of Halloween candy... - And a few scary old black and white monster movies! - The Ralph Drabble version of Octoberfest!
dr061022 -- rake rake rake - rake rake rake rake - Whew! - I hate this time of year! - It's too much work! - I can never keep up with all of dad's candy wrappers! Ralph, please save some for the trick-or-treaters!
dr061023 -- Good morning Wendy! Norman! - I was just wondering what happened to you! - Why? Am I late? - No, I was just wondering what happened to you!
dr061024 -- Do you have any plans for after school, Norman? Absolutely! - First, I'll ask Wendy for a date. When she says no, I'll probably sit around and play video games for the rest of the day! - Well, have a good time! I intend to! - I may have no
dr061024 -- life, but it's the only life I don't have!
dr061025 -- KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK! - Good morning! We're from the church of... - Aw, forget it! - Nobody wants me!
dr061026 -- Dad, this movie isn't scary! Not scary??! It's The Wolfman!! He scared me to DEATH when I was a kid! - When the moon is full, he gets all hairy and starts to howl!! How can you not be scared of something like that?? - It's 2006! We have cable
dr061026 -- TV and the Internet! - Kids see scarier things every day! Now, THAT'S scary!
dr061027 -- I can't believe you kids don't think these old monster movies are scary! - When I was a kid, I'd sit in front of the TV, petrified with fear! - I was so scared, I'd even forget to eat my popcorn! - Something tells me you eventually
dr061027 -- remembered. Yeah, I was usually able to compose myself during the commercials!
dr061028 -- Let's go smash the Drabbles' pumpkin! OK! - - On second thought, maybe we shouldn't! - Another prank thwarted by my GLARE-o-lantern!
dr061029 -- Nice job of decorating the front porch for Halloween, Ralph, but please put the picture of my mother back on our nightstand! Yeah, I guess we don't want to TERRIFY the little kids!
dr061030 -- - Trick or treat! - Thank you! Halloween is a lot easier since I installed a drive-thru!
dr061031 -- KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK - Trick or treat! - Thank you! - Now THAT'S a costume!
dr061101 -- - It's sad when Halloween is over! - Apparently, not for everyone! fa la la la la la la la la!
dr061102 -- - There you go! Good as new! Uhh...thanks, dad. - ...and YOU wanted to run out and buy a new one! He re-tied a broken rubber band?? Keep in mind your father throws nickels around like they're manhole covers!
dr061103 -- It's nice when a man can take a walk with his entire family! - It's an opportunity to spend time together communicating! - Although, it would be nicer if we communicated with each other! yakkity yak yak yak yak yakkity yak yak
dr061104 -- Wrappers! Wrappers! - Nothing left but wrappers! Everything is gone! - YES!! - Four days after Halloween, the candy corn finally starts to look good!
dr061105 -- - - - - - Return Carts Here CLANK! YES! My turn! They can turn anything into a competition!
dr061106 -- Hello. You've reached the Drabble residence. Please leave a... - Wait a minute...there's usually SOMEBODY home! I wonder why none of us is answering? - Maybe something BAD happened! - WHOEVER IS LISTENING TO THIS MESSAGE, PLEASE CALL THE
dr061106 -- POLICE!! 'kay, bye! Maybe someone else should record our answering machine greeting!
dr061107 -- ...yawn... - What's everybody staring at? - There are crop circles in the hair on your back! Don't worry. It's probably a hoax! That's it. I'm going back to bed!
dr061108 -- Remember, Norm, I want the leaves raked and the car washed! - Don't worry, dad. I'm on it! The only thing he's ever on is the couch!
dr061109 -- Hello, news radio? This is traffic tipster Drabble! I'm calling to report a DRABBALERT! - A "Drabbalert"?? I know a "Sigalert" is a major traffic jam on a highway, but what's a "Drabbalert"? - A major traffic jam at a fast food drive-thru!
dr061109 -- BURGER
dr061110 -- Hello, newsradio? Traffic tipster Drabble here, with an update on the "Drabbalert"... - The location of the "Drabbalert" is the Galtburger drive-thru! Traffic is at standstill! - It all started when someone in a red pickup couldn't decide
dr061110 -- what to order, and is now trying to use an expired coupon! - And if that wasn't bad enough, my son has to go to the bathroom!
dr061111 -- Hi, Wendy! Hi, Norman. - - - 'kay, bye! Thanks for sharing your thoughts.
dr061112 -- - - - - - - - - Frozen Yougurt I want to sample every flavor! Me to! Me too! Me too! Oh dear! I can't decide! I ALMOST beat 'em in line! At least you got some exercise!
dr061113 -- boodle oodle oop! - boodle oodle oop! ...Sigh... - What the heck do YOU want?! I didn't know our phone had "caller i.d."! It doesn't!

dr070328 -- How could you be so thoughtless?! - I'd been scrubbing that floor all day long, and you tracked in mud!! - You tracked mud across the floor, eh? Yeah, five years ago! - Why is she getting mad at you for something you did five years ago?? It's

dr070403 -- Penny, quit dragging around that teddy bear! - You don't need to hold on it all the time! - I know it gives you a sense of security, but you need to let go of it occasionally! - I'll let go of my teddy bear if you'll let go of the TV

dr070406 -- Hi! Hello! - How are you? Fine. - I don't believe we've met. My name is Norman! - I'm so excited to meet a new friend! Hang on. Some weirdo is trying to talk to me!
dr070407 -- You know what they say... - If it looks lie a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck... - It's probably a duck! - Or else it's a rare South American parrot that takes on the characteristics of a duck for survival in the jungle!
dr070408 -- I can't find any of my easter eggs! - I've looked everywhere! - The easter bunny is pretty clever, Norm. He probably hid them somewhere he knew you'd never, never look! - - - FOUND 'EM!!! Where were they hidden? - Inside my college textbooks!
dr070408 -- Hey, speaking of that, how's your spring break homework coming along?
dr070409 -- Gooood morning, DRABBLE FAMILY!! - Your home is about to become EXTREMELY MADEOVER! - Ralph, we chose your home because your application video brought tears to our eyes! - Kids, what's it like to know your dad is a hero? He's a WHAT?? Mmpff!
dr070409 -- - They're very proud!
dr070410 -- Drabble family, your home has been selected to be EXTREMELY MADEOVER! - Why didn't you TELL me they were coming?! I didn't know they'd show up at the crack of dawn! - Excuse me...I don't mean to sound ungrateful, but could you guys take your
dr070410 -- TV cameras and come back in an hour? I need a little more time to make myself presentable! Make it two hours!
dr070411 -- Drabble family, our design team has arrived to build you a brand new home! Sweet! - I was hoping you could do something like this... - That's Hearst Castle! Yeah, go nuts!
dr070412 -- Ralph, while our design team is remodeling your home... - You and your family will be sent on a week-long, all expense paid trip to... - Disney world? New York? The Carribean? Hawaii? - Spanky's Motor Lodge in Buellton! Darn! That's where we
dr070412 -- went on our honeymoon!
dr070413 -- Hello again, Drabble family! - We hope you're having a nice vacation in exciting Buellton while your home is being remodeled! - As you can see, the wrecking ball is here to demolish your house! - I sure hope you took out all of our worldly
dr070413 -- possessions! Actually, YOU were supposed to do that, Ralph! *crash**
dr070414 -- The wrecking ball has just destroyed your roof, and your fabulous remodel is underway! - Hold on, folks...I've got a call from our show's producer! Hello?...I see...'kay, bye! - Well, Drabble family, it seems that our show has just been
dr070414 -- cancelled, so... - We're outa' here. Sorry about your roof! At least we got to see Buellton! Darned contractors!
dr070415 -- Good night, honeybunch! Good night, Ralph! - Nitey-nite, Penny! Good night, daddy-o! - G'nite, boys! G'nite, dad! 'nite, pa! - YES!! I'm a FREE MAN!! - Everyone is in bed, and the house is ALL MINE!! - I can do anything I want! I can eat
dr070415 -- chips! I can watch TV! I can... - Z
dr070416 -- - - - I guess I don't quite have the hang of using my new cell phone camera!
dr070417 -- Listen to this, dad! A daily 30-minute walk can extend your life 1.3 years! - Let's see...30 minutes a day...that's 182.5 hours of walking per year... scribble - Carry the two...divide by seven... scribble scribble scribble . Forget it!
dr070417 -- That's only a net gain of six weeks...
dr070418 -- Boy, what a lousy day THIS is going to be! - It's probably going to rain! Why did I bother to get out of bed?!  - Where are you going? I'm giving a speech at the Optimist's Club! But probably no one will show up!
dr070419 -- Going for another walk, mom? Yup! Exercise is important! - I don't want to have JUNK in my TRUNK - It's bad enough having a LARD in my YARD!
dr070420 -- Your father falls asleep in that chair every night! Z - RALPH! WAKE UP AND GO TO BED!! Z - Poor dad... - In the morning, he has "BED-head", and in the evening, he had "CHAIR-hair."
dr070421 -- Ralph, have you been walking with your new pedometer? - I most certainly have, honeybunch! - So far today, I've walked 2.4 miles! - Good for you! That means it's exactly 1.2 miles to the doughnut shop!
dr070422 -- Uncle Drabble's World Of Fun! Hi, Kids! - These two pictures are almost identical, but there is at least *one mistake*! Can you figure out what it is? - Answer: Ralph made the mistake of saying, "Aw, crud! We're having spaghetti again??"
dr070423 -- Ralph, do I look fat in this dress? - - Of course not! - Liar! At least I'm a LIVE liar!
dr070424 -- No television, no toys, no iPod, no computer, and no playing outside until your attitude changes! - OK, maybe you ARE the boss of me!
dr070425 -- We're back from the movie! - What kind of movie did you see, dad? A chick flick, heavy on the "ick"!
dr070426 -- I have an amazing talent! I instinctively know the exact time of day! Go ahead, ask me the time! What time is it? - 11:42! Wrong. - 11:53? Nope. 12:27? Wrong. 1:04? Nope. 2:36? Nope. - This is still Thursday, right?
dr070427 -- Why did they give us each two forks, dad? ...sigh... - Norman, I can't believe you don't know! They ALWAYS give you two forks at finer restaurants! - How come? In case you drop one, of course! - Oh yeah, huh! You really need to get out more!
dr070428 -- YES! scoop scoop scoop  - Relax, honeybunch! The carton says this ice cream only has 90 calories per serving!
dr070429 -- ...and I'd also like to thank my family for their encouragement and support... - And I'd especially like to thank the flavors of peanut butter and chocolate for making this all possible! Dad's acceptance speech is running a little long! Oh
dr070429 -- well, it's not every day you receive a lifetime achievement award from the frozen yogurt shop! Can you wrap it up, Ralph? I've got customers!
dr070430 -- Dry Cleaners One pair of pants to be dry cleaned, please. - Do you think you can get out that big chocolate stain? It depends how long ago it occurred. - Generally speaking, the sooner you bring it to the cleaners, the better the chances are!
dr070430 -- - We should be OK, then!
dr070501 -- SNORRRRRRE! fwweeeeeeeeee! SNORRRRRE! fwweeeeeeeeee! - My husband is a sound sleeper in more ways than one! SNORK! gurgle! wheeze! SNORRRRE!
dr070502 -- Ralph, my cousin Daryl called today... - He's got a lot of bills to pay, so I decided to lend him some money. - I hope that's OK! - Most people have an extended family...we have an overextended family!
dr070503 -- - Hello, Norman... Shhh! - My mind is engaged. - Your mind's not even going steady!
dr070504 -- EGADS!! - A person with no name is calling me!! - My cell phone always displays the caller's name! How weird! I thought EVERYONE had a name! - Why would someone with no mane be calling ME?? Maybe he wants to talk to someone with no brain!
dr070505 -- I don't know what they're called, but they're a lot of fun! - We have them all over the house! - Dad doesn't like it when I play with them. diddle diddle diddle diddle diddle diddle diddle diddle - That must be why he hides them behind doors!
dr070506 -- - Hey! Why are you kids playing outside?? Well, it's a nice day, and... - Do you know how much money I spent on that new video game system you just had to have?! - A BUNDLE!! And now you guys want to play OUTSIDE?? I don't think so! - Now, go
dr070506 -- play indoors! Yes, sir! - And don't give me some lame excuse about having too much homework! Way to lay down the law, dad.
dr070507 -- - Dad asked me to fill the pool so he could go swimming! - Is that all the water we have?? - That's all the water he needs!
dr070508 -- Good heavens! Why is mom yelling?! !!! - Oh... - That's just her "I'm wearing my iPod" voice! SO, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE FOR DINNER?!!
dr070509 -- - - pop! SPLOOSH - Before you try to play with an empty water bottle, make sure it's empty!
dr070510 -- I sure wish I could ask Candice for a date! - Why don't you, Stu? I have no confidence. - I'd make a complete fool of myself! I'd mess it up! It would be a total disaster! - For a guy with no confidence, you're pretty confident! I'd get shot
dr070510 -- down so fast, everyone would call me "skeet"!
dr070511 -- Go ahead, Stu! Walk over there and ask Candice for a date! - Don't be afraid to take a shot! - YOU never take any shots! I take plenty of shots! - Unfortunately, I'm a human air ball!
dr070512 -- Oh, boy! Brownies!! They're not for you, they're for my book club! - If you eat any of these brownies, there will be serious repercussions! - In fact, if you even THINK of eating a brownie, there will be serious repercussions! - Technically,
dr070512 -- there are known as "PREpercussions"!
dr070513 -- Happy mother's day, Mom! I hope you enjoyed your mother's day brunch! - And all your cards and gifts! I did! Thank you all for everything! - So, what's for dinner tonight? Do you have time to iron my golf shirt? My gym uniform still needs to
dr070513 -- be washed! - Could you help me with my art project that's due tomorrow? Mother's day is a misnomer. It should be called "Mother's Hour-And-A-Half"!
dr070514 -- I need to put extra sunscreen on my tummy! - Whenever I sunbathe, my stomach is the only part of my body that gets sunburned! - I can't figure out why! Maybe because it's closest to the sun!
dr070515 -- Norman, I've folded all your clean laundry. - Will you take it up to your room, please? Uh...sure. - Tell me when I get to the stairs! Heaven forbid he'd have to make more than one trip!
dr070516 -- Here's your clean laundry, Patrick. - I spent a lot of time folding it, so carry it up to your room carefully! - I made it to my room without dropping anything!! Good! -
dr070517 -- Have a seat, Ralph! Thanks, Jerry! - How have you been? snip snip Fine, thanks! - How's the family? snip snip snip Oh, they're... - All done! My haircuts don't take as long as they used to!
dr070518 -- - - What's with Wally?? Beats me. - All I said was "don't bark". Crud. I thought he said "dog park"!
dr070519 -- Ralph, no hurry, but could you fix the bathroom sink? Sure! - - - In the language of marriage, !no hurry! means "get off your duff."
dr070520 -- - pick pick pick pick pick pick pick pick pick pick pick - rake rake rake - - - - You are so impatient! Why should I have to wait until October to jump into a pile of leaves?
dr070521 -- I can't understand why your mother wanted an iPod! - She said now she can listen to her favorite songs around the house without bothering anybody! - EVERYBODY WAS KUNG FU FIGHTING... - So much for that theory!
dr070522 -- I'm home! - Hi, honeybunch! Sock it to me Sock it to me Sock it to me... - AAAAAAAHH!!! - Don't sneak upon me like that!! A thundering herd of wildebeests could sneak up on you!

dr070524 -- With her iPod on, your mom can't hear a word I say! Watch... - Honeybunch, I met another woman! We're running away to Brazil! Hope you don't mind! - First I'm going to have a slice of that cake you baked for your mother! - If you touch that
dr070524 -- cake, you'll live to regret it!! Apparently, she's OK with the Brazil thing though!
dr070525 -- - - - Honeybunch, I can't believe you have these songs on your iPod!! I don't! That's mine, dad!
dr070526 -- - - - I've discovered that it's more fun to be a people-watcher than a people-watchEE!
dr070527 -- - - - - - - - - Ralph, I asked you a question! Does my new dress make me look chunky? Why aren't you answering?! My life is still flashing before my eyes!
dr070528 -- The average person eats 35,000 cookies in a lifetime! - I'm living on borrowed time!
dr070529 -- Beat it, you dumb dog! - skattle skattle skattle - I said, "beat it, you dumb dog," not "let's go for a walk"! You need to enunciate!
dr070530 -- Whoa! I have a brain freeze! - Believe it or not, Wendy, I have never had a brain freeze! - - nah...too easy!
dr070531 -- ...nine...ten...ELEVEN FEET! See, Patrick? Your oom IS bigger than mine! - Now, help me pick up all these foot-long hot dogs! We really need to by a tape measure!

dr070605 -- Oops! I dropped a nickel! - - Why did you drop all these other coins? - I didn't want to bend over for just a nickel!
dr070606 -- Mom... - Can I go over to Tyler's house? - I suppose. Thx. - What's with the thumbs? Too much texting!
dr070607 -- I want you to know, Wendy, that I'm nothing without you! - Unfortunately, you're nothing WITH me, either! No now...don't put yourself down!
dr070608 -- SPLOOSH! - I hate it when Mom makes me wash the windows! - - Mee too. Sorry, my bad!
dr070609 -- Wendy, before I go, I'd like to leave you with a thought... - - - Don't hurt yourself, Norman! I might have to get back to you...
dr070610 -- - Hey, what are you doing?? - I'm throwing away your old shirt! It's got stains all over it! - Those aren't STAINS! Those are MEMORIES!! - This is a ketchup stain from a hot dog I ate at an American League playoff game in 2002! - And this
dr070610 -- spaghetti sauce stain is from new year's eve, 2005! Remember? - And I got this chili stain at the county fair last summer! How could you even THINK of throwing this away?! - Some people take photos to remember the past...my husband spills
dr070610 -- food on himself!
dr070611 -- Hmm...this green looks fast! - I always marvel at how golfers can tell if a green is fast just by looking at it! - The speed-bump is a tip-off!
dr070612 -- - ** - It wasn't pretty, but I'm out of the trap! Any "out" is a nice "out"!
dr070613 -- - - Nope. This ball is a Callaway number two. Mine was a number one. Keep looking. - As long as our family has a pet duck, I might as well make use of him!
dr070614 -- Oh boy! Here comes the wagon! It's about time!! - In addition to the snack wagon, some of the tougher golf courses also offer the psychiatric counseling wagon! Help me, doc! This game makes me crazy, but I keep coming back for more!
dr070615 -- How was your golf course, Ralph? Terrible! - How many balls did you lose? Two. - That's not so bad, is it? - Unfortunately, he also lost a putter, his 3-wood, and the golf cart!

dr070619 -- What's wrong, Bob? - You seem a little depressed. - Why so down-in-the-beak? - Ha ha! Get it? Joining this comic strip was a bad career move!
dr070620 -- I'm wasting my career! - What am I doing in this comic strip, anyway? - I never get any good lines! - Who does? Good point!
dr070621 -- I've had it! I'm tired of being underutilized around here! - I'm going to go outside and take a long waddle! - Let's hope I don't meet with all fowl play! - See the kind of witty material you've been all missing?
dr070622 -- Bob the Duck ran away from home! - We better find him! He's probably halfway  to Brazil by now! - Bob! I thought you ran away from home! Dang! You mean this is still part of our home out here?
dr070623 -- Bob, running away from home is just a quack for help! - I'm sorry you feel like we've been ignoring you in this strip! - Our editor is making a note to enure you're treated with more respect around here! - Editor's Note Treat duck with more

dr070625 -- Wendy, I was wondering if you'd...uh...like to go steady with me. - Norman, I thought you'd never ask! - No. - I've been looking forward to that for so long! - Glad you enjoyed it.
dr070626 -- How was your doctor's appointment, Ralph? - He gave me some new diet pills! - He promised me the weight will drop off if I follow the instructions! - "Take one pill three times a day, on empty stomach."
dr070627 -- - - - That's not fair! Son, the day you can beat me to the TV clicker, you'll be a man!
dr070628 -- Son, a boy doesn't just "get" to use the TV clicker... - He earns the privilege by becoming quicker than his father! - When the day comes that you can grab this clicker away from me, then you can keep it forever! - Really?? Yeah, but don't
dr070628 -- get your hopes up. I didn't get it from my dad 'til I was 37!

dr070714 -- Patrick's Lemonade $3 Hi Stu! Hi Leonard! How sad! - What could be worse than working at your little brother's lemonade stand? - Norman, I'm going to have to let you go. Any other questions? Does this mean there's a job offering?
dr070715 -- OUT! - OUT??!! - You made a TERRIBLE call, Blue! I made a terrible call??! What about YOU?! - What kind of manager calls for a sacrifice bunt with TWO OUTS?! Uhh... - Or trying to send a runner from first to third on an infield single?! Well,
dr070715 -- I... - Or having a runner try to steal second with the bases loaded?! That was a little mix-up! - YOU'VE made more bad calls than I have today! You're a disgrace to the game!! - Stop it! Isn't the MANAGER supposed to kick dirt on the UMPIRE??

dr070718 -- You think I'm a geek, don't you? - Of course not, Norman! - Geeks usually have some sort of useful technological knowledge. - And no one can accuse you of that! Really?? Thank you!
dr070719 -- You're hard to categorize, Norman. - You're not really a GEEK, and you're not a DWEEB exactly... - You're sort of a cross between a dweeb and a geek! - I'm a DWEEK!
dr070720 -- Wendy, it doesn't matter if you think I'm a dweeb, a geek or a dweek... - For I know there are really only two kinds of people in the world... - Those who MAKE things happen, those who WAIT for things to happen, and those who ASK what
dr070720 -- happened! - ...and also, those, who don't know what happened! Don't forget those who can't count!
dr070721 -- Uh-ho! We better fast-forward the movie right here! Yeah, there's a ragy scene coming up! - Close your eyes, mom and dad! I miss the good old days when PARENTS used to monitor what their KIDS saw!

dr070725 -- This stupid duck is driving me crazy!! - Actually, dad, Bob isn't a duck, remember? - He's a rare south American parrot that takes on the characteristics of a duck for survival in the jungle! - So, why is he living in a tract home in the
dr070725 -- suburbs??! Our backyard looks like a jungle!
dr070726 -- You know, Bob, I appreciate the fact that, in reality, you're a rare south American parrot that takes o the characteristics of a duck for survival in the jungle... - But around here, you stand a better chance of survival if you DON'T act like
dr070726 -- a duck!
dr070727 -- AH-CHOO!! - sniff! - How come you didn't say "bless you"?! - Ahh-CHOO!! Because you always sneeze twice! Bless you!
dr070728 -- Honeybunch, is it OK if I eat this last muffin? Yes! - Penny likes those for breakfast, but I can always run to the store and buy more. - Hopefully they'll still have them in stock. Sometimes they run out. I just hope I can get there before

dr070801 -- - - Hey Norm, help me out! Did I put on my pants? Not yet. - OK, thanks! You know, it might be time to invest in a treadmill!
dr070802 -- Here, Ralph. I bought you a pair of "cargo" pants! - What are "cargo" pants?? - They're made with extra room for guys like you who have more to carry around! - Oh yeah! Look at all the pockets! That's not necessarily what I was referring to!
dr070803 -- Keys, wallet, cell phone... - Comb, pen, ice cream scooper, a can of aerosol cheese. - Ketchup, mustard, salt and pepper, chocolate syrup, TV remote.. - Let's see...what else will I need today? I'm glad you're enjoying your new "cargo" pants!
dr070804 -- - - - The only problem with "cargo" pants is that I can never find my phone!
dr070805 -- Tell me again why I have to stand here! Because YOU'RE the one who forgot the umbrella! It's OK, dad! You provide more shade anyway!
dr070806 -- $%"§%§%&$&$ - $§$%$%§$%&$&$%& - Yes, dear! - That's usually the best answer when I have no idea what she's talking about!
dr070807 -- How can I be sure this is really a South American Parrot? - Bob spent time in Brazil! He's fluent in Portuguese! - Quanto custa para alugar uma cadeira de conves? - That means "how much does it cost to rent a deck chair?" Something tells me

dr070810 -- Could somebody help me with the door? - Kids? Could one of my children help me with the door? Please? - Never mind. I got it! - I hope I never need a kidney!
dr070811 -- I'm back from the mall! - Here, Ralph. I bought you another pair of pants. I hope they fit you! - "Relaxed Fit" sweatpants. - Yeah, those should be OK!

dr070813 -- This hole is 217 yards long. Water on the left, sand on the right! - How do you suggest I play it, caddy? - Try to hit the ball off the condo so that it ricochets back on the cart path, takes a wild bounce, and lands five feet from the pin! -
dr070813 -- I CAN'T DO THAT! You did it last time!
dr070814 -- Darn! I can't find my ball marker! - Do you have anything to mark my ball with? Sure, dad! - - How's that? Dad's Ball-->
dr070815 -- Can I hit one, dad? No, you don't know how. - Golf is a game of skill. Only after years of practice and dedication will you be able to hit a golf ball without embarrassing yourself! - blap! - And even THEN it's practically impossible!
dr070816 -- OK, Norm. Although you're not an experienced golfer, I'll let you take a shot! - First, think about club selection. It's 178 yards to the pin. The wind is blowing from the east... - Select your club carefully. Hmm... - This is a pretty one!
dr070817 -- - - FORE!! I haven't even hit the ball yet!! Sorry.
dr070818 -- - - - tokkl-okkl! - A HOLE_IN-ONE?!! That's good, right?

dr070822 -- Club House It's not fair...I've played golf for 30 years... - Norman plays for the first time, shoots a hole-in-one, and now everyone's making a fuss over him! RING! - He gets publicity, adulation, gifts... - Congratulatory phone calls...
dr070822 -- Norman, it's Lefty on line two! Thanks for calling, Tiger! Kiss the baby!
dr070823 -- We're here with Norman Drabble, who scored a hole.in-one today on his very first golf shot! - Tell us about it, Norman! Well, my strategy was to drive the green and put the ball in the hole on the third bounce! - Unfortunately, it took four
dr070823 -- bounces, so there's room for improvement! And Norman's proud father Ralph is also here... - What do YOU have to say, Mr. Drabble? I played pretty well myself! I had a birdie on the... OK, back to you in the studio!
dr070824 -- Mr. Drabble, you were a witness to your son's remarkable hole-in-one. Tell us about it! - It was dumb luck. - - Anything you'd like to add to that? He used MY BALL and MY CLUB! I should get SOME credit!!
dr070825 -- Norman, do you think your father is jealous of your hole-in-one? Absolutely not! My dad thought me everything I know! - He taught me how to tee it up and how to follow through! My dad is the greatest! - I LOVE YOU, SON!! - He also thought me
dr070825 -- how to kick the ball out of the rough when no one's looking! OK, son! That's enough praise! sniff!
dr070826 -- I think I'm catching a cold. - Maybe a peanut butter and jelly sandwich will make me feel better! - Wait a minute...is it "feed a cold, starve a fever" or "starve a cold, feed a fever"? - "Feed a cold, starve a fever." Thanks! - I can't get
dr070826 -- the lid off. Is it "righty-tighty, lefty-loosey" or "righty-loosey, lefty-tighty"? - It's "righty-tighty, lefty-loosey." - You sure do get your phrases mixed up! - Then again, he's not the sharpest light bulb in the tool shed!
dr070827 -- The weather is hot, and autumn is just around the corner. - This is what's known as the Dog Days of Summer! - Or, in our case, the WIENER DOG days of summer! skattle skattle skattle  Interesting how they always come in packs of ten! skattle

dr070901 -- Mmm-MMM! I feel like a new man already! - Dad's idea of health food is strawberry ice cream!
dr070902 -- Ralph, for heaven's sake! Park the car already! - Yeah, dad! Why are we going to the very back of the parking lot?? - Because when you have a fancy new car, you like to park it as far away as possible and hope that no one parks next to you! -
dr070902 -- New car owners can be a little paranoid! - Oh yeah, huh! That makes sense! - ...except we don't HAVE a new car! Your father like to park right next to the new car owners just to annoy them! It's a long walk, but well worth it!
dr070903 -- Why on earth don't you take off your shirt? I'm afraid I'll be the worst-looking man on the beach! - Never mind!
dr070904 -- 'bye, kids! Enjoy your first day of school! - Remember, don't hug anyone, don't kiss anyone and don't touch anyone! - And don't say anything that can be misconstrued, or do anything that could result in costly legal action! - And look both

dr070908 -- Dad, have you ever considered buying one of those talking navigational systems? - Move out of this lane, Ralph. It's going too slow! Turn left at the next signal! Not this signal, but the one after that... No.
dr070909 -- Nice shot, dad! Thank you, caddy! - I'm kind of tired, so I rented a cart for today's round! Sweet! - Drop me off at the outhouse!
dr070910 -- ...and I'll have the chicken pasta with mushrooms, peppers and onions. - But hold the mushrooms because the last time I ordered this, I had a violent reaction! - Of course, maybe the onions and peppers gave me the violent reaction. - I guess
dr070910 -- we'll find out! - Did I say I'd have dinner with you tonight? I meant to say I'm busy!
dr070911 -- Restaurant Wendy, are you embarrassed to be seen in public with me? - Whatever gives you that idea?
dr070912 -- I need to find a new girlfriend. - There are 10,000 women at this school. If I stand here and ask each and every one for a date, someone is bound to say yes! - Hello. I'm Norman Drabble. And you are...? - Not interested. O-for-one.

dr070915 -- Hi, I'm Norman. Would you like to go out with me? No. - Hi, I'm Norman. Would you like to go out with me? No. - Hi, I'm Norman. Would you like to go out with me? - OK! Sorry, I'm busy!

dr070923 -- - FORE!!! - - WHACK! - SEE?!! Maybe you'd do better if you exuded more confidence...
dr070924 -- Welcome To The Ballpark! I'm glad we could come to the baseball game, Ralph! - I love all the sights and sounds...and those unmistakable smells of the ballpark! Me too. - The hot dogs, the roasted peanuts, the team... - The team smells?

dr071027 -- Great Halloween decorations, Ralph! - I love the spiders and cobwebs all over your house! - And the bones scattered around the front yard are a nice touch! - Great job! I haven't put up any Halloween decorations!
dr071028 -- The autumn leaves are really pretty! - If you look at them closely, you'll be amazed at how highly detailed they are! - Wow! You're right! - They even have nutritional information! Ralph, if you're going to eat all of our Halloween candy,

dr071102 -- Time to take down the Halloween decorations! - What about the signs? I think I'll leave those up in case any of your relatives drop by for the holidays. Turn back now! Trespassers will be eaten! Go away! This means you!! Beware
dr071103 -- Dad, can I drive the car to the store? I suppose. - Be careful! - Don't drive too fast, don't talk on the cell phone, and don't tailgate! - AND DON'T CHANGE ALL MY RADIO BUTTONS!!

dr071104 -- he wasn't looking!
dr071105 -- Dad, I've decided to become a ventriloquist! - I'd like you to meet Pancho! Say hello, Pancho! - Hi! My name is Toncho! I'm a hand puppet! - Ow! That gave me a cramp! I guess I'll have to live vicariously through YOUR achievements, Patrick!
dr071106 -- I'm fat! No, you aren't! - You're just saying that because you have to! I am not! - You mean, you WOULDN'T feel like you had to tell me I wasn't fat?? Uhhh... - Boy, what an uncompassionate LOUT! What happened here??
dr071107 -- I'm fat! Honeybunch, you look the same as you did when I married you! - So, you're saying I was fat when we got married?? - That's the meanest thing you've ever said to me! No it isn't! - What about last night when I said, "this is the best
dr071107 -- dinner you've ever made"??
dr071108 -- I don't understand...it's 7:00 A.M., and those morning TV hosts are Chipper and Perky and look like a million bucks! - I prefer the hosts of the OTHER morning show. - Good morning. What's good about it?! They're more realistic!
dr071109 -- Watch this...I saw it on "Stupid Pet Tricks"... - I put a cookie on his nose like this, and he can't eat it until I say so! - I love it when he starts to drool!
dr071110 -- ...sigh... - I KNOW I'm in the slowest-moving lane, honeybunch! I'll move over as soon as I can!! - - Force of habit!
dr071111 -- KLUNK! - roll roll - - - trip! - - - Penny, the next time I order you to get me a soda, move a little faster! Just don't open that until I get back into the house!
dr071112 -- Hi, dad! No. - Why do you always assume I'm going to ask you for money? No. - Why can't I just say hi to you without thinking I want something? No. - I promise to pay you back! No.
dr071113 -- One pack of gum and one quart of milk. - Do you have any coupons? No. - Do you have a V.I.P. customer savings card? No. - What a loser! That'll be $35! Something tells me I need one of those V.I.P. customer savings cards!
dr071114 -- We're running late, Ralph. - I'll have to put on my makeup while you're driving! - In that case, I'll go really really slow! - I MEANT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE LESS BUMPY!!
dr071115 -- WHIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR Did you ask one of the kids to vacuum upstairs? No. - WHIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR That probably is not a good sound then, is it? It's never good when the kids vacuum without being asked!
dr071116 -- Yes! Paper Towels 1/2 Off - Why so many paper towels? You can "T.P." a house in half the time!
dr071117 -- YANK! - pull! pull! tug! pull! yank! tug! - ...sigh...
dr071118 -- Check out my new satellite dish, Ralph! - I now receive programming from the world over! I can watch sports all day long! - In fact, I'm going inside now to watch a little basketball! See ya, Ralph! See ya, Steinbauer! - Ahh, this is the
dr071118 -- life! - ? - - What the... - Hee hee!
dr071119 -- Wendy, I can envision spending the rest of my life with you! - So can I, Norman. Wow! Really?? - Absolutely. - Because if you drip chili on me one more time tonight, I'm going to kill you! Thorry!
dr071120 -- What's on TV? - Another presidential debate. - How come I don't recognize any of the candidates? - It's for the 2012 election! Boy, the campaigns really ARE starting earlier and earlier!
dr071121 -- Ralph, you've been saying you were going to fix the roof since last spring! - So when do you plan to get around it? - I'm shooting for the weekend! He puts the "pro" in procrastinator!
dr071122 -- Hi, uncle Vern! Ralph! What brings YOU here?! - Well, last summer, you invited us up for thanksgiving dinner, so we made the long drive and here we are! - Ralph, here in Canada, we celebrate thanksgiving in OCTOBER! Oh yeah, huh. - This is
dr071122 -- why I don't like to put you in charge of things!
dr071123 -- - I always wondered how they put the decorations on the top of the mall's Christmas tree! The hard part is standing it back up!
dr071124 -- - And I thought I was a good dad because I had pictures of my kids in my WALLET!
dr071125 -- Ralph, why are you so dressed up?? - We're just going to the movies, you know! In the old days, people always dressed up for the movies because they recognized the cultural significance of the cinema. I happen to feel the same way. - Also, I
dr071125 -- refuse to pay six bucks for a bucket of popcorn! You have melted butter running down the side of your head!
dr071126 -- Poor Wally! - I feel bad that you have to be on a leash. But then again, you ARE just a dog! - We humans don't need to be on leashes because we are smarter than...oops, hold on... - Hello? Yes, dear...I'm just walking the dog...
dr071127 -- - - You don't see many mall cops wearing a cape! - And don't you forget it!
dr071128 -- Care to go to the movies tonight, honeybunch? Are you kidding???!! - Tonight is Christmas eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve EVE!! - This is traditionally a very busy night
dr071128 -- for me! - What could I have been THINKING?? If all goes well, I might have a little time on Christmas eve eve eve eve eve!
dr071129 -- Why do you always flip through the channels so fast? How can you possibly decide whether to watch a program when you only give it a split second?? flip flip flip flip - Why do you always turn the pages so fast? How can you possibly understand
dr071129 -- the complex concepts that the author worked so hard to...
dr071130 -- ...a can of aerosol cheddar cheese, a can of sharp cheese, a can of American cheese and a can of nacho cheese! - Ralp Drabble's "Four Cheese Pasta" coming right up! Whose idea was it to let dad cook dinner?
dr071201 -- ...sigh... What's wrong, Dad? - I can't find my reading glasses! - You don't WEAR reading glasses! Oh yeah, huh! - I've lost my mind! Try looking between the sofa cushions!
dr071202 -- I told you to slow down, dad! Now you're going to get a ticket!! - Relax, son. Watch how I handle this! - Hello, fellow officer! May I see your license and registration, please? - I'll give you one better! Here's my license, my registration,
dr071202 -- and my BADGE! - What kind of badge is THIS? - I happen to be a real, live mall cop! - And, since we're colleagues in law enforcement, I'm sure you'll want to extend a professional courtesy, and send me on my way! - That didn't work at all!
dr071202 -- I'll tell you one thing: If he ever tries on clothes at the mall, he better not take more than three items into the dressing room!
dr071203 -- We should throw out this chair. WHAT? - You can't throw out my favorite chair! It's taken me years to break it in just right! - It has to go! It's old and saggy and lumpy and stinky! - If you throw out that chair, you'll have to throw me out,
dr071203 -- too! You certainly meet the "throw out" criteria!
dr071204 -- WHERE'S MY CHAIR!! I hauled it to the dump this morning! - YOU WHAT??!! - I loved that chair!! It was in perfect condition! - Ralph, the DUMP didn't even want it! I had to pay a hazardous waste disposal fee! I need to find it before wrestling
dr071204 -- comes on!!
dr071205 -- I've got to get to the dump before it closes! I can't believe my wife threw out my favorite chair!! - What are the odds of finding it?! I'll be like looking for a needle in a haystack! - May I help you? MY CHAIR!!
dr071206 -- That is MY CHAIR!! No it isn't. It's mine! - It was brought to the dump this morning because nobody wanted it! - Why anyone would part with such a comfortable chair is beyond me, but who am I to question my good fortune?! - How can my day get
dr071206 -- any worse? Speaking of fortunes, look at all the money I found under the cushions!
dr071207 -- I demand that you surrender my chair immediately!! Only if you can prove it's yours! - OK! Look under the front of the chair, on the right-hand side, behind the skirt! - See that orange stain? That's where I wipe my fingers after I eat
dr071207 -- cheetos! - You call that proof? Everyone dose that! I WANT MY CHAIR!
dr071208 -- I want that chair back! It's mine and I love it! I don't believe you. - If you love this chair so much, explain to me how it could possibly  have ended up at the dump? - Did I mention that I'm married? - How did you get it back? He finally
dr071208 -- believed me!
dr071209 -- putt! - roll roll roll - - bounce bounce! - bouncy bounce! CRACK! - BING BANG - FORE! - I've never heard anyone yell "fore" after a putt! OW!
dr071210 -- Isn't that cute?! - There's nothing like young love. - Come on, Ralph! Get off your keister! Help me carry these bags! We've got a lot more shopping to do!! ...especially OLD love!
dr071211 -- Here's another package to carry, dear! - Ahem! - Sorry, wrong husband!
dr071212 -- OK, Wally...on your mark, get set... GO! - - - - Trimming the tree goes faster when you involve everyone in the family! pant pant pant
dr071213 -- Every year, the Christmas decorations go up earlier and earlier around here! - The carols have been playing since October! - It makes the mall seem low key! Have a good day at work, Ralph!
dr071214 -- Bye, honeybunch! I'm off to work! - I'm glad she likes to decorate for the holidays, but sometimes I think she overdoes it! - Like when she decorates my air freshener!
dr071215 -- Honeybunch, you know I always love it when you decorate for Christmas... - But you've got to know when to quit! Are you saying you don't like the indoor snow machine?
dr071216 -- You kids are so impatient! Yeah, maybe we should wait until it snows a little more before we build a snowman! Wait! Here comes one more! Maybe it would look better with a hat!
dr071217 -- Happy holidays! Love, the Drabbles! - Your turn. ...sigh... - PS: I'm sorry I look like such a dweeb. -Ralph - If it looks so bad, why are we using the picture for our family-photo card?? Because everyone else looked good!
dr071218 -- chirp chirp! - It's from dad. - eJumw bifppvk +oaaa+. .tbq k - People over 40 shouldn't even TRY to send text messages!
dr071219 -- It's no use. Don't give up. dad... - I know it's hard for a man your age to learn hoe to send text messages, but the key is practice, practice, and more practice! - But that's probably enough practice for one day! Ow!
dr071220 -- Delivering secret Santa cookies is so much fun! Park here, Ralph! Our first family lives over there! - Here, take the cookies to the front door, ring the bell and run back before anyone sees you! Why do I have to do it?? - Because it's SO
dr071220 -- MUCH FUN! Oh, yeah, huh! - Just go with the flow, dad! Every time I go with the flow, I get soaked!
dr071221 -- OK, dad...here's how the "Secret Santa" thing works... - We leave a plate of cookies on the doorstep, ring the bell and run back to the car before they see us! - OK, hand me the plate of... - COOKIE?? Don't worry. I left the biggest one.
dr071222 -- Here, Ralph. You can deliver secret Santa cookies to the Byrnes! - Leave the cookies on the porch, ring the bell and run back to the car before they see you! I know, I know! - He rang the bell! Here he comes! I've never seen him run so fast!
dr071222 -- - WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THEY HAD A DOG?! Oh, don't be such a baby!
dr071223 -- 'twas the night before Christmas... - 'twas?? Short for "it was"! They should've just SAID "it was"! Yeah, they only saved one letter! - When all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. They had MICE?! Everyone had
dr071223 -- mice in those days. That's disgusting! - The stockings were hung by the chimney with care... Yeah, right. If they did anything with care, they wouldn't have mice! Was this before the black plague? Aren't you supposed to hang them ON the
dr071223 -- chimney? - ...in hopes that Saint Nicholas soon would be there. "Saint Nicholas"?? Short for Santa Claus! Nah-Ahh! Saint Nicholas has 13 letters and Santa Claus only has 10! - That ended early! I didn't want to get into the dancing
dr071223 -- sugarplums!
dr071224 -- Well, I'd better get back to work, Ralph! - Last year, I got home an hour late, and I never heard the end of it! - Thanks for the midnight snack, and good luck with th in-laws tomorrow! See you next year! - He's a nice guy!
dr071225 -- A sweater for Wally? - What kind of dumb Christmas gift is that?? - What could look more stupid than a wiener dog wearing a sweater?? -
dr071226 -- HO! HO! HO! Santa! You came back!! - I just wanted to make sure everyone got what they wanted! We did! We did! - Yeah, right. I know why you really come back... - Here. I found your wallet in the fireplace! YES!!
dr071227 -- I don't understand it, Ralph. Why do you like to sit in the garage so much? - It's cold, and cluttered and uncomfortable! - You'd never find ME sitting out here! - Bingo!

dr071231 -- tone is the key of C or D!
dr080101 -- I've got the chips, dip, pizza and soda! And I've got the candy, cookies, crackers and cheese! - What about your new year's resolution to avoid junk food? - New year's resolutions never go into effect until after the rose bowl!
dr080102 -- Ice cream?? - Ralph, it's the second day of January! - What about your new year's resolution to lose weight? - My resolutions don't take effect until you put away your Christmas CD's. oh, it's beginning to look a lot like...

dr080112 -- happens to be a real duck! Let's go home, Spot!
dr080113 -- Remember, Ralph, tell them not to grill my Hamburger bun! I want only a teensy bit of mustard, and tell them to use soft lettuce instead of the crunch kind. And ask them to substitute zucchini for french fries! - - - Why are we going backward
dr080113 -- into the drive-through?? - I'd rather let your mother order for herself! ...and use soft lettuce instead of the crunchy kind! And substitute zucchini for french fries...

dr080122 -- sprinkle?? - Yes, Ralph. How DO you explain that? I think I need a lawyer!
dr080123 -- I can explain why the donut sprinkle was in my car! Please do, Mr. Drabble. - Although I am on a strict diet, it was my turn to bring donuts to work yesterday. - When I stopped for a redlight, the box fell on the floor, and a sprinkle must
dr080123 -- have fallen off! I see. - OK, I have to go now. Remain seated, Mr. Drabble, The prosecution has not concluded its questioning!
dr080124 -- Mr. Drabble, do you maintain that you've strictly adhered to your diet for the past week? I do. - How, then, do you explain the presence of this chocolate chip on the passenger seat of your car?? - Simple. I picked up a hitchhiker who turned
dr080124 -- out to be "Famous Amos." - Wow! He thinks pretty fast under pressure! I can't wait to hear how he explains the "Nutter Butter" in his pants pocket!

dr080227 -- FINE! GOODBYE!! - My brother Bud is so inconsiderate! - He called me to remind me that today is our sister's birthday, and that I should call her! - What's wrong with that? He wouldn't tell me which sister!
dr080328 -- Why are you swimming in my water dish? Ducks like water. - Can't you find someplace else to swim? - Sorry. It's the only place available. - Someone left the lid down on the porcelain pond again!
dr080329 -- Today is February 29th, Penny! It's leap year day! I know. It's not fair! - Why does it have to be in FEBRUARY?? - Why can't they put the extra day in summer vacation or spring break? - I never thought of that! Better yet, they could squeeze
dr080329 -- it in between Saturday and sundae!
dr080301 -- Good evening, parents! Welcome to another exciting little league season! - I'm coach Rick, and I'll be running your child's team! - My own son will be the star of the team, doing most of the pitching and batting clean-up! He'll play every
dr080301 -- inning of every game! - I decided to become a coach for one reason: to ensure that my son makes the all-star team and gets a big trophy! - If your child id not a good hitter, that's fine. I'll teach him never to swing the bat, and to try to
dr080301 -- get hit by a pitch! - I will teach your child what little I know about baseball, unless he starts getting better than *my* son. Then your child will get benched. - Hey, at least this coach is honest! For my year-end coach's gift, I'd like a
dr080301 -- gift certificate from Ted's Steak House!
dr080302 -- What do you think of my new dress, Ralph? - scribble scribble scribble - SSHHHRRIKK! - Hmmm..."hideous" is 1 1/8 inches long... - "interesting" is 1 11/16 inches long... - "unique" is only 7/8 inches long. - Unique! Over the years, dad has
dr080302 -- learned to measure his words carefully!
dr080303 -- Sigh What's wrong? - I have to write a column for the Pole-Cat Lodge Newsletter but I can't think of anything! - I have a bad case of writer's cramp! - Don't you mean writer's BLOCK?? No. Whenever I'm blank, I get nervous and eat too many
dr080303 -- peanuts!
dr080304 -- Dang! I have to write a column for the Polecat Loge Newsletter, but I have writer's block! - Relax, dad! You can't have writer's block! Why not? - Because you're not a writer! So? - I have an athlete's foot and I'm not an athlete!!
dr080305 -- If you have writer's block, it helps to pace back and forth! - They say it gets the creative juices flowing. - HEY! I think it's WORKING! - False alarm. I'm just getting sweaty!
dr080306 -- Have you thought of a subject for your column? Nope. - I don't understand why it should be so difficult for a well-informed guy like me to think of something to write! - Why don't you just write something about the upcoming elections? - We're
dr080306 -- having an election?
dr080307 -- - - -
dr080308 -- Have you thought of anything to write for the newsletter, Ralph? Nope. - When is your column due? In two hours. - You're in trouble! Hey, some people do their best work under pressure! - And if you happen to know anyone like that, please ask
dr080308 -- them to come help me!
dr080309 -- RING! - RING! ...sigh... - RING! Oops! kick! - RING! Stub! OW! - RING! RRROOWR!! - HELLO! - Hi, dad! I'm just calling to see when Mom wants me to come downstairs for lunch. - By the way, what's all that racket down there? ...Hello? - Tell me
dr080309 -- again why we thought Norman needed a cell phone.
dr080310 -- - He looks even scarier in high definition! Z
dr080311 -- Officer, this young man is behaving rudely! - - DON'T GLARE AT ME, BRO! DON'T GLARE AT ME!!! - Who needs a taser when you've got "The Glare"?!
dr080312 -- Mall Cop Headquarters Meeting In Progress Keep Out! Fellow mall-cops, some of our crime-fighting techniques have come under scrutinity. - Therefore, we will no longer be using the "Mall Cop Restraining Device." Aww! - The good news is, if
dr080312 -- anyone can get Mr. Smith out of it, he promises not to sue!
dr080313 -- Goooooooooodd... - Mooorrrrninnng... - What are you doing? Rehearsing. - I have to give a ten-minute oral report in school tomorrow!
dr080314 -- Supermarket May I help you, Mr. Drabble? I have a complaint... - The chips are on aisle 2, the ice cream is on aisle 7, the soda is on aisle 12 and the donuts are on aisle 18. - If you could put all the things I normally buy on the same
dr080314 -- aisle, it would save me a lot of walking around! - Actually, Ralph, we figure you need all the exercise you can get!
dr080315 -- Your grand total comes to $64.92 Wait, I've got some coupons. - Can't you at least cut them out of the newspaper, first? Do I have to do EVERYTHING??!
dr080316 -- Why is that such a popular spot? It's one of the few places in town that doesn't get cell phone reception!
dr080317 -- Management just doesn't understand, No-Neck... - Every mall cop must have that all-important INTIMIDATION FACTOR! I know, Ralph, bur they want us to look festive! - Happy St. Patrick's Day! I think on Easter, I'll just call in sick!
dr080318 -- I think I need to see the doctor! - Yes, make an appointment immediately, honeybunch! You look TERRIBLE! - You look like you're a hundred years old! - I need to see the doctor because I strained my thumb! I meant, of course, a very YOUNG
dr080318 -- hundred!
dr080319 -- SIGH! - One would think you'd have a more comfortable stomach! One would, would one?
dr080320 -- Sorry you can't go out with me tonight, Wendy. Maybe next time! - ...OK, maybe the time after that, then! - ...well, OK, then. Maybe the time after that! - OK, well then maybe...
dr080321 -- So Wendy didn't want to go out with you, eh Norm? Well, don't be discouraged. I'm not! - She said she couldn't go out this time... - Or next time, or the time after that or the time after that. - But she said nothing about the time after
dr080321 -- that! I'm glad she left a crack in the door!
dr080322 -- Norman, you keep asking Wendy for a date, and she always turns you down. - Why do you keep asking her? - Because when I was a little kid, dad, you told me to never give up! - Since when do you ever listen to ME?? I think I'll call her again!
dr080323 -- Mom! Dad! Wake up!! - The Easter Bunny forgot to  hide eggs! WHAT?? - He better NOT have forgotten!! - We can't find any eggs anywhere! OK, OK...I'll check out! - Ah, yes...that easter bunny is pretty clever! - Look! He hid all the eggs in
dr080323 -- side this carton, and put it in the refrigerator! Wow! What a great hiding place!
dr080324 -- Family, I have an announcement to make! - As you know, I have worked as a mall cop for years. - Apparently, my capacity for greatness has finally been recognized! You mean... Yes, honeybunch. - I have been nominated to become the next chief
dr080324 -- justice of the food court!
dr080325 -- Congratulations on becoming the next chief justice of the food court, Dad! - It's not a done deal. The confirmation hearings are tomorrow. - Are you confident you'll be confirmed? Absolutely! - I already bought my outfit! I think you're
dr080325 -- supposed to wear pants under the robe, dad!
dr080326 -- Mall The food court confirmation hearings will now come to order! - Mall cop Drabble, congratulations on being nominated to be the next chief justice of the food court! Thank you, sir! - That's certainly an impressive array of medals you've
dr080326 -- accumulated! - Hey, those are my boy scout merit badges!! Shhhhh!! Go ride the escalator for a while!
dr080327 -- Mall cop Drabble, what qualifications do you have to become chief justice of the food court? - My experience as a mall cop has prepared me for this office! - I have dined in this food court every day for the past 25 years! - Often 2 or 3
dr080327 -- times a day! Yeah, he may even be OVERqualified! - DON'T HELP ME!
dr080328 -- Mall cop Drabble, if you are confirmed to become the next chief justice of the food court... - Do you intend to legislate from the bench? - Absolutely not! - I'm hoping they'll give me a big, comfortable chair!
dr080329 -- Mall cop Drabble, we need a person of integrity to be the next chief justice of the food court. - Whenever I give away free samples of my Teriyaki chicken, you always take more than one! - And then, you don't even BUY anything!! Therefore, we
dr080329 -- reject your nomination! - This hearing is adjourned! Would you like your toothpicks back?
dr090330 -- When I was a kid, my dad made sure that his family always sat together at the dinner table and communicated! - Now that I'M a father, my family sits together and communicates, too. - Unfortunately, just not with each other! *chirp* text text
dr090330 -- press *chirp* press press text text *chirp* *chirp* text text press press
dr080331 -- I'm home! bark bark bark bark bark bark bark bark - You dumb do! Don't you recognize me? - - You're a hard guy to recognize from down here!
dr080401 -- Norman, I've come to the realization that I've been wrong about you... - You are actually a pretty swell guy, and I'd like to spend more time with you! - Very funny, Wendy! APRIL FOOL TO YOU, TOO! - I hope!
dr080402 -- The wife is mad at me. - She's making me sleep on the couch! - Why can't you sleep on your OWN couch? Let's just say she's pretty mad!
dr080403 -- Maybe I shouldn't go to work. I don't feel so good! - How do I look? - Like a million bucks. Really? - Yeah, lumpy and greenish!
dr080404 -- Hi, Stu! Hey, Becky! - Hi, Stu! Helly, Kelli! - Gee, Stu! You're suddenly getting some positive attention from the ladies! - I've discovered that if I hang out with someone who's a bigger loser than I am, I seem more appealing!
dr080405 -- Hi, Stu! Why, hello, Monique! - The key to looking more desirable to the ladies is to always hang around someone who's a bigger loser than you are! - You should try it, Norman. - ...assuming you can find someone who fits in that description.
dr080405 -- I'm afraid the buck stops here.
dr080406 -- Whoa Look at that! What, honeybunch? - You're getting "Old Guy Neck"! What??! - You're wrinkly and saggy! You're getting "Old Guy Neck"! - OH YEAH?? WELL YOU'RE GETTING... - lovelier each and every day! Thank you, Ralph! - I may have "Old Guy
dr080406 -- Neck", but I'm too old to die!
dr080407 -- Here's the new heart, Mr. Drabble! Thank you, nurse! - SPLAT Oops! - THREE-SECOND RULE!! - Did you hear me, Wendy? I said I'm considering becoming a surgeon! Sorry. I was just trying to picture that!
dr080408 -- Hello? Oh, yeah...OK. 'Bye! - Who was it? It was Norman reminding me to turn off my cell phone in the theater!
dr080409 -- I'm back from the store! - I couldn't find the broccoli... - So I bought you a watermelon, instead. - I figured they were both green! I hop you'll enjoy your cream of watermelon soup!
dr080410 -- - - Tell me again why I wanted a cat! - Because my mother is allergic. Oh, yeah...nice kitty!
dr080411 -- - - What could be happier than a wiener dog in springtime? Me at a Las Vegas buffet!
dr080412 -- Z - Norman, it's almost noon! - ROLL OUT OF BED!! - KLUNK! Ow! He's so literal!
dr080513 -- Dad, LOOK!! - There's a SNAKE on our neighbor's roof! - Relax, it's fake. Our neighbor put it up there himself! - How come?? To scare away varmints, and keep birds from building nests on the house. - Some people put rubber snakes on top of
dr080513 -- their houses, some people use fake owls...it has to be something scary enough to frighten critters away! - Maybe you should put something scary on OUR roof! I already did! - Hey! What happened to the picture of my mother?
dr080414 -- - - - I see you've discovered Spider Solitaire!
dr080415 -- I'm feeling kind of down. How about some pancakes? - Pancakes? Pancakes make people happy. - It is impossible to be unhappy while eating a stack of pancakes! - It's worth a try, I guess! If you're seriously depressed, I'll make you waffles!
dr080416 -- You're right, dad! It's impossible to be sad when you're eating a stack of pancakes! - I have a question, though... - Is it proper to use a knife to cut pancakes, or can I just use a fork? - I may not be the best one to ask!
dr080417 -- I have another question about eating pancakes... - Is it better to pour syrup over each pancake, or just over the top pancake and let it drip down? - - What was the question? Never mind.
dr080418 -- See what I mean, Norm? - No one can be unhappy while they're eating pancakes! - YOU TWO MADE A MESS IN THE KITCHEN! YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES!! - Now I don't feel so happy again! No problem! I'll make some more!
dr080419 -- I've noticed that most of these prime-time game shows build the tension by stretching everything out! - - - Really?? We'll find out after this commercial break!
dr080420 -- - - - - - DING! KLUNK! STRIKE!! - Right into the elevator! I love mall cop bowling! - The mall closed a long time ago, How come dad isn't home from work yet? Mall cops must have a lot to do after hours!
dr080421 -- I'm becoming more health conscious. - My doctor told me to take an Aspirin tablet every day! - Good for you, dad! - Although, I can't imagine he told you to wash it down with chocolate syrup!
dr080422 -- Pancakes Dad! Why are there pictures of you in the window of a restaurant?? - It's the "Ralph Drabble Restaurant Rating System." - "Two tongues up"!
dr080423 -- I can't believe you have a restaurant rating system! - The public trusts my fast food opinions. Two "tongues up" means EXCELLENT. - One tongue means AVERAGE. - I don't care for this place!
dr090424 -- Let's see...I need to check the calendar... - What the heck?? - Honeybunch, why is last year's calendar hanging on the wall? - Because the pictures are much prettier than this year's calendar!
dr080425 -- Nice day day at the beach, eh, Norm? - How come you're wearing your sun visor around your neck? - The glare of my stomach is blinding!
dr080426 -- RING! I'll get it! - Hello? May I speak to professor Drabble, please? - PROFESSOR Drabble?? That must be one of my students! - I teach a night course in "mall coppery".
dr080427 -- Mall Good morning, fellow mall cops! Good morning, commander Murray! - Thank you for showing up this early morning hour. - I admire your bravery and courage in fulfilling this most difficult and unpopular assignment! - Now go out there,
dr080427 -- unlock those doors, and remember: you're the last line of defense against complete pandemonium! ...sigh... - I hate "morning mall-walkers" duty! On your left, Slowpoke! Coming through! SINGLEFILE, YOU ANIMALS!! Me first! No, ME!
dr080428 -- - - - The house always gets a bit more tidy when Ralph wears his cargo pants!
dr080429 -- I bought a camp chair! - Ahhh! It has a warning tag. - "Maximum load: 250 pounds. Damage could occur if chair is subjected to heavier loads." - Say what? Never mind.
dr080430 -- Plop! - beep beep boop - You won't believe what Troy just did! He made a SPECTACULAR catch!! - It was AMAZING! The crowd went wild! Another objective report from the little league field!
dr080501 -- Welcome to Galtburger! Hey. It's me. - Oh hi, Ralph! Long time, no see! - Has it really been that long? - Yeah, breakfast was seven hours ago! Oh yeah, huh!
dr080502 -- I'm ready to go! - You're going out wearing THAT? Sure! - For your information, very few men look good in tank tops! - Thank you!
dr080503 -- Are you just going to sit in front of the TV all day and eat peanuts?! - I haven't been here that long! - OK, maybe I have!
dr090504 -- She'll have the chicken sandwich, and I'll have a cheeseburger! - FWEET! - That is the 1,000th cheeseburger you've ordered from our restaurant, Mr. Drabble! - You are now a member of our loyal customer hall of fame! - On behalf of everyone
dr090504 -- here at Down-N-Out Burgers, thank you and congratulations! - That was a little embarrassing! The ceremony over at the taco shop was much more dignified!
dr080505 -- Look what I bought, Ralph! - It's a satellite navigation system for our car! - It will tell you where to go, tell you where to get off, and tell you when you're going the wrong way! - I thought that was YOUR job! I can't be with you all the
dr080505 -- time!
dr080506 -- This navigational device will help us find our way around town! - Honeybunch, we've lived here for 20 YEARS! I already know my way around town! - Besides, I have a keen sense of direction! Sense of direction??! - You once got lost in a
dr080506 -- drive-thru car wash! - There was very poor visibility in there!
dr080507 -- Ralph, you'll be so glad I bought this navigational system for the car! It's a waste of money! - It will pay for itself over time! We don't need it! - You'll be amazed at all the things it can do! Who cares! - It even shows you where all the
dr080507 -- fast food restaurants are! Let me see that!!
dr080508 -- I've entered our destination into our new navigational system. Just do what it says! - Turn left at the next signal. It TALKS?? Sure! - How come it sounds like a girl? A female voice is more soothing. - And you're much more apt to do what it
dr080508 -- says! I said TURN LEFT! Yes, Ma'am!
dr080509 -- Turn right in 5 miles That's wrong! - Turn right in 0.3 miles NO! - Maybe this navigational system wasn't such a good idea... - So far, it's taken us half an hour to go three miles! Turn right here NO! YES! NO! HONK! BEEP! HONK! HONK! BEEP!
dr080510 -- Turn left here! No! That's the wrong way! - Turn left here! Turning left will take us way off course! - I'm the navigational system! TURN LEFT HERE!! Fine. - Oops! My bad!
dr080511 -- I like our new widescreen TV, dad! Me too, Norm! - I almost didn't buy it, though... - Your mom didn't think it would fit on our wall!
dr080512 -- Mom and dad are going to the mall cop awards banquet tonight! - They're getting all dressed up. It must be formal! - Is it black tie and tails? - Black hat and apron!
dr080513 -- I'm looking forward to the mall cop awards banquet! It's a fancy event! - We're even getting picked up by a chauffeur! We're riding in a limo? - Even better! A stretch mall cop security vehicle!
dr080514 -- Mall Cops Awards Tonight You seem nervous, Ralph! - I'm expecting to win the lifetime achievement award! What makes you think so? - Are you kidding? I was the one who INVENTED the term "Mall Cop"! It's about time Ralph Drabble got a little
dr080514 -- recognition! - Besides, the other guy who's up for the lifetime achievement award is only nineteen!
dr080515 -- Mall Cops Awards Tonight Do you really think you're going to win the lifetime achievement award, Ralph? - Well, I don't want to get my hopes too high... - I need to be realistic. Anything can happen. - I just hope I didn't forget to thank
dr080515 -- someone in my acceptance speech!
dr080516 -- The first award to be presented tonight is "Most Improved Mall Cop." - Then we will present awards for "Best Smile" and "Best Personality." - JUST SKIP TO THE LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD!! - I want to get home in time to see "Dancing Wit The
dr080516 -- Stars."
dr080517 -- The recipient of the lifetime achievement award is a man you all know... - He is a true visionary...the first mall cop ever to use the Chinese finger lock as a law-enforcement tool! - Then, at his own expense, he equipped each and every one
dr080517 -- of his fellow mall cops with one of their own! - That must have cost you a fortune! Nah. I won 'em all at Chuck E. Cheese's!
dr080518 -- Excuse me, Mr. Mall Cop... - There are some thugs outside the mall, who are up to no good! - Thank you, concerned thipster! I'll go apprehend them immediately! - But, officer, I'm afraid that they might seek retribution against me! - Fear
dr080518 -- not! We'll put you in the mall cop witness protection program! - What do I do? Follow me... - Just stand still and try not to blink!
dr080519 -- Mall Cops Awards Tonight The lifetime achievement award goes to a man you all know. - He is responsible for several mall cop pastimes, such as mall bowling and escalator jousting! - This man is indeed a living legend in the field of mall
dr080519 -- coppery! - Don't get a swollen head! Who, me?
dr090520 -- Tonight's recipient of the lifetime achievement award is the man who actually coined the term "Mall Cop." - Before that, we were just known as "indoor retail security personnel", which wasn't as catchy! - None of us would be able to call
dr090520 -- ourselves "mall cops" today, if not for this man! - Why are you crying? I never realized how GREAT I was!
dr090521 -- Hi, mom! Hi, dad! Norm, you're just in time to see me receive the lifetime achievement award! - Isn't that what they give to old people when their career is over? What?? - Yeah, they give somebody a lifetime achievement award, and then they
dr090521 -- don't feel so bad about getting rid of them! - Ralph, you look sick! Maybe he ate too many cocktail weenies!
dr090522 -- I'm getting out of here, honeybunch! WHAT?? - Norman just pointed out that they only give lifetime achievement awards to people whose careers are over! I'm too young for this!! - And the winner is RALPH DRABBLE! Where are you, Ralph? - Ralph?
dr090522 -- Come out from under this table! No!
dr090523 -- Ralph! Come back!! - We need to give you your award! Stop him!! - OOF! HEY! OUCH! LET ME GO!! - Good work, men! No problem! Ralph is pretty easy to outrun!
dr090524 -- I don't WANT a lifetime award! I'm too young!! But, Ralph! Look at all you've contributed... - The holiday spirit violation, mall bowling, mall golf, the mall cop olympics, the junior mall scouts... - You're just giving me a lifetime
dr090524 -- achievement award because you intend to phase me out!! - That's not true! We're giving it to you instead of a raise! Oh, OK then!
dr090525 -- I love to watch the Extreme Home Makeover show! It's so heartwarming! - Sniff! - SOB - HONK - - - Why can't I watch my favorite show without everybody staring at me?!! - Because OUR favorite show is watching you watch YOUR favorite show!
dr080526 -- Guess what, everybody! It's our lucky day! My boss gave us five free tickets to the ball game! Let's go!! - Dad! Can I get an ice cream cookie? It's only $7! Me, too! Me, too? You all just had hot dogs and Sodas! Nothing is quite as expensive
dr080526 -- as free tickets to the ball game!
dr080527 -- Hey, Steinbauer! Your stupid dog woke me up, barking again! - What are you going to do about it? - Good boy! SNARF!
dr080528 -- Steinbauer, your dog woke me up, howling this morning! - You should train that dumb dog! - I DO train him! - Repeat after me! Arrooooo! ARROOOO!!
dr080529 -- How's your sore foot, Ralph? - It's hard to tell at my age. - I can't figure out if my foot is getting better... - Or the rest of me is getting worse!
dr080530 -- The shower has been running for half an hour! - knock knock knock HEY, NORM! YOU'RE WASTING HOT WATER!! GET OUT OF THE SHOWER NOW!! - I haven't even gotten in yet!
dr080531 -- Ralph, we're going to a party tonight! Rats! I hate parties! - Why? Mall cops never enjoy social gatherings because people always ask us professional questions... - !What time does the mall open?" Or "when is the next midnight madness
dr080531 -- sale?"... - Being a mall cop is like being a doctor. Everyone wants to pick your brain! You should've picked a different one!
dr080601 -- OK, dad, open wide! - - Hmmm... - SMACK SMACK - The expiration date on that cottage cheese is June 5th. - Incredible! Right again!! I'm surprised "America's Got Talent" turned him down!
dr080602 -- I'm so excited! I just bought tickets to the NEIL DIAMOND concert! - Isn't he the guy who walked on the moon? No, that was Lance Armstrong! - I thought he rode a bike! No one ever rode a BIKE on a MOON!! - ? You need to read more books!
dr080603 -- Yadda yadda yadda - Yabba dabba doo zip a dee doo dah - Nanu nanu - It doesn't matter what you order here, since they never get it right, anyway! You want onions on that?
dr080604 -- Dad, how do you pronounce "irrefutably"? - Is it Ir-REF-u-ta-bly, or is it ir-re-FUT-a-bly? - How would I know?? I've never said that word! - Ask him how to pronounce "Sausage McGriddle".
dr080605 -- - ...Yawn... - fold - I've never seen anyone "Dog-Ear" page ONE before. Let's just say I'm not a fast reader!
dr080606 -- - - Here you go, son! - You didn't have to make me pancakes! I don't need to be cheered up yet! Then consider them preemptive pancakes!
dr080607 -- Ready for the beach, Norm? - Are you kidding?? I can't go out in public looking like this? Why not? - I have a FARMER'S TAN!! - So what's wrong with at least LOOKING like you have a job??
dr080608 -- CRUNCH! CRUNCH! CRUNCH! . RUSTLE RATTLE KRINKLE RRIP! - COUGH! COUGH! - SLURRRRRRP! SLURP! SLURP! - Yakkity yak yak! - - How inconsiderate! Don't you know to turn off your cell phone in a theater??!
dr080609 -- Dad, haven't you always said that age is only a number? - That's correct, son! - Well, here's my report card. - And remember, my grade is only a letter!
dr080610 -- WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH - - From a distance, it looked like a scratching post!
dr080611 -- The pool is filled, Dad! Nice! - WOOSH! And now the lawn is watered!
dr080612 -- - - KNOCK KNOCK - You know it's time to clean out the fridge when you feel you should knock before you open the door! Come in!
dr080613 -- zzZzz - zzZzz DADDY, WAKE UP!! - WAKE UP, DADDY!! WAKE UP!! Wha..?! - I'm going to wrap you father's day present, so DON'T PEEK!
dr080614 -- - Dang! I used up all our sunscreen! - Sorry, honeybunch! That's OK. When I'm sitting near you, I don't really need it!
dr080615 -- Mall skattle skattle skattle - skattle skattle skattle skattle - - skattle skattle skattle skattle  - skattle skattle skattle skattle skattle I hate "bring your wiener dog to work" week!
dr080616 -- YAK YAK YAKKITY YAKKITI YAK! - Excuse me, you're in a restaurant, not a phone booth! - Show some consideration for others and take your cell phone conversation outside! - Sorry, no-neck...now, what were you saying?
dr080617 -- I'm going to the snack bar again, honeybunch! Sniff! - I'll help the next person in line! No thanks. We'll wait! I sense that I'm not the only guy who got dragged to this "chick flick"!
dr080618 -- - - WAA HA HA HA HA - Boy. What a corny joke! I hate it when the grocery checker reads my greeting cards!
dr080619 -- Meat - Fire. - Any questions? Nope. - Thanks for the barbecuing lesson, dad. It's easy after you've had it explained to you!
dr080620 -- How was the "Star Trek" convention, honeybunch? Great! - I got a tattoo of the starship Enterprise on my ankle! WHAT??!! Relax. It isn't permanent! - And neither is the tattoo of William Shatner! I don't even want to know where that one is!
dr080621 -- All done! Wow! - It's very impressive that dad does a crossword puzzle each and every day! - Actually, he only does the SUNDAY crossword. - It takes him a week to finish it!

dr080623 -- confidence!
dr080624 -- How come we have to wait way back here? - The pharmacy likes to protect the privacy of their customers. - ...sometimes. WHO IS HERE TO PICK UP THE TOENAIL FUNGUS MEDICATION?!
dr080625 -- I like this machine, Norm... - You put your arm in the cuff, press the button, and it tells you if you have high blood pressure! - Want to try it? No thanks. I know I don't have high blood pressure! - That's true. He's just a carrier!
dr080626 -- Every time I come here, I check my blood pressure on the machine! - I put my arm in the cuff, press the button... - And it tells you if your blood pressure is normal high or very high! - What was it last time? It must have been pretty high.
dr080626 -- All it said was "Holy cow! Call an ambulance!"
dr080627 -- Yesterday I drove ten miles with the emergency brake on. - Oh, and I just remembered, I left a gallon of ice cream in the trunk! - Norman, maybe you shouldn't talk to me when I'm having my blood pressure taken! - Uh-oh! Here's that bill you

dr080628 -- This automatic blood pressure machine is very convenient. - There's only one thing I don't like about it... Sometimes my arm gets stuck!
dr080629 -- Dad, I have a cooking question... - If a hot dog happens to roll off the barbecue... - Can you still eat it if you pick it up within three seconds after it hits the ground? I wouldn't know... - - CLOMP! Nothing has ever hit the ground!

dr080706 -- - - - - Could someone toss my trunks please? That's why you shouldn't go head first on the slippy side! Now *there's* an image that could scar me for life!
dr080707 -- Honeybunch, I've been doing a lot of thinking... You must be exhausted. - Our son Norman is growing up. Soon he'll be on his own, and I'm concerned... - Have I taught him all he needs to know? Have I imparted enough... - WHADDAYA' MEAN, I
dr080707 -- MUST BE EXHAUSTED??!
dr080708 -- Sometimes I feel like I haven't spent enough time with Norman. - I don't know if I've taught him enough to succeed in life. - My time with him is running out. He's growing so fast! - Has anyone seen my other floatie? Okay, maybe not *that*
dr080708 -- fast!
dr080709 -- Norman will be out on his own before we know it. - Time is running out for me to bond  with my son and impart all of my vast wisdom and knowledge. - Therefore, Norm and I are taking a road trip together! Who knows when we shall return,
dr080709 -- right, son? - Hopefully, before gas hits $7 a gallon! Bring something to take notes with. I plan on saying a lot of brilliant stuff!
dr080710 -- Norm, it's important for a young man to have self-confidence! - Remember, you can do anything you set your mind to! - Always know that your father has complete and total confidence in you! - Can I drive for a little while? NO!!
dr080711 -- Son, the reason I wanted to go on this road trip is so I could impart all my knowledge and wisdom before you leave home. - - - Did I mention that the loose french fries at the bottom of the bag always taste the best? Yeah, you covered that
dr080711 -- one!
dr080712 -- Where are Dad and Norman? They went on a father and son road trip. - Norman will soon be an adult, and your Dad wanted some time to impart all of his wisdom and knowledge. - How long do you think they'll be gone? My guess is about half an
dr080712 -- hour. We're back!
dr080713 -- - - - - - I tried to tell you not to put on so much sunscreen!
dr080714 -- ...here's something else I've thought about: I'll bet the parents of Cedric the entertainer are very happy. - Their son became exactly what they named him! - On the other hand, I wonder if Larry the cable guy's parents are disappointed that
dr080714 -- he's not a cable guy. Check, please! You haven't even ordered yet!
dr080715 -- Disguises - - He must be going to the movies. Or bowling! Actually, lots of places give senior discounts! Anyone seen my "bald-head" wig? I thought you were wearing it!

dr080717 -- chop! - - - WHACK!
dr080718 -- How was your golf game? - I lost 18 balls. How on earth could anyone lose 18 balls? - Well, I didn't actually *lose* them... - I just hate bending all the way over to pick 'em up!

dr080723 -- Gee, dad! What are you doing out here in the yard?? - Son, tending the garden nurtures the soul and gladdens the heart. - Why would anyone want to be indoors on a beautiful day like this? - Sounds like Mom is on the warpath again! OK, that

dr080728 -- Oooh...I shouldn't have eaten that last chilli dog! - I've got a major bellyache! Should we call 911? - You don't call 911 for a *bellyache*! The who should we call? How about the gas company!
dr080729 -- Where's Dad? - He's in the backyard, assembling his new patio swing! - How's the swing? I think it needs oil!
dr080730 -- Aren't you going to the beach with us, Norm? No, I'm embarrassed by my farmer's tan! - Don't be silly! A farmer's tan is nothing to be ashamed of! - I stand corrected.
dr080731 -- - - Never ask Patrick to fold the laundry!

dr081008 -- How are your "Memoirs of a mall cop" coming, Dad? - Slowly. I know I've had an exciting career, but I can't seem to remember much about it! - Obviously, I have subconsciously blocked the more traumatic events from my memory! - How about the
dr081008 -- time you accidentally drank of no-neck's thermos? I'm saving that story for the climatic ending!
dr081009 -- I have finished my manuscript! Now I'll submit it to the publisher! - "Memoirs of a mall cop" is destined to become a literary classic! - - SLAM! Dang! I just thought of a better ending!
dr081010 -- Dad, something came for you in the mail! - It's from your book publisher! They probably read my manuscript and are prepared to offer me a contract! - Go ahead and read what it says! - "Dear aspiring writer, thanks, but no thanks." How did
dr081010 -- they know I was sweaty?
dr081011 -- I can't believe I got a rejection slip! - How could they turn down "Memoirs of a mail cop"?? - Maybe you should write a book about your other job, Dad! - "Memoirs of the guy who stood at the entrance of Bulk Club and checks your membership

dr081020 -- Frankie Rodriguez would admire that save!
dr081021 -- Remember to keep your eye on the ball, honeybunch! - WHACK! - Darn! - My ball didn't hit the tree like yours! Mine just went straight down the middle! sigh
dr081022 -- It's a great idea for me to learn to play golf, isn't it, Ralph?!! - Now, instead of having to play golf all by yourself, I can come with you and keep you company! Isn't that great?! - HEY, SLOW DOWN! YOU DRIVE LIKE A MANIAC! HO *THAT* WAY!!
dr081022 -- - Anyway, as I was saying... Maybe i could take up windsurfing!
dr081023 -- BOOF! - Sigh - BOOF! That looks like fun! I wish *I* could hit my ball into the sand!
dr081024 -- SPLOOSH! - Golf isn't fair. - You keep getting to use a new ball, and I've used the same one all day!
dr081025 -- Hi, Elanie! Guess what! I'm playing golf with my husband! - No, I don't know what the score is. We're not keeping track anymore! - After the first hole, Ralph had nine and I had only four! - I guess he didn't want me to feel bad for having

dr081223 -- ...on the second day of Christmas, my true love gave to me... - Two turtles and a partridge in a pear tree - - Why did you stop singing? Most people slam their doors by now!
dr081224 -- If you look up the sky, Penny, you might see Santa and his reindeer! - Look! I see a red light moving across the sky! It's probably Rudolph!! - Actually, it looks more like a twin engine 737 making its final approach to the airport! - It's
dr081224 -- probably the nine o'clock flight from Atlanta! Penny might be getting a little too old for this!
dr081225 -- Gather 'round this, kids, for dad's annual reading of "Twas The Night Before Christmas." - Kids?? I think they might be getting too old for it. - - Yeah, but *Dad's* not too old for it!!

dr081229 -- Christmas was kind of a letdown this year. How come, Dad? - I guess I was a little disappointed with my gifts. - What are the odds of getting six nose hair trimmers?? In your case, pretty good!
dr081230 -- Free samples - YECCHH! That's AWFUL! - The worst dip I've ever tasted! - Although, it might be OK with crackers! Ralph, that's scented body butter.
dr081231 -- Why are you making so many pancakes?? - I volunteered to help decorate floats for the tournament of pancakes parade on new year's day! - Tournament of PANCAKES?? How many do you need?? - The Eiffel Tower float alone requires 7,000 pancakes,
dr081231 -- 450 waffles and 2 slices of french toast!

dr090106 -- Hi, Wendy! - Fist bump! - HONK! - Did I miss? Sorry, I'm not wearing my contacts. I wonder if Howie Mandel has to put up with stuff like this?
dr090107 -- Hurry, Ralph! Let's get inside the store before it closes! - Don't forget your keys, honeybunch! - Can't you just hold on to them for me? - I'd rather not!
dr090108 -- Congratulations, Dad! - Someone from your credit card company called while you were gone. - They wanted to speak to you about your OUTSTANDING BALANCE!! - I am proud to be your son! ...sigh...
dr090109 -- Honeybunch, I'm a happily married man and I love you dearly. - I am completely loyal and devoted to you, and you alone. - But if "Deal Or No Deal" model #16 ever happens to call me, all bets are off! - Women *say* they want honesty in a
dr090109 -- relationship, but they really don't.
dr090110 -- Would you like half of my giant-size candy bar, Wendy? - No, thanks. - You know, on second thought, maybe I will! - Thay what?
dr090111 -- - Creak! - I see the holiday bills are starting to arrive! It's always the first avalanche of the year!
dr090112 -- Listen, Wendy. I may not be the smartest guy in the world... - I may not be the handsomest or the best-dressed... - Or the most athletic or the most talented or...or... - I forgot where I was going with that! So far, so good, though!
dr090113 -- - - - She's kind of mean! Tell me about it!
dr090114 -- - Maybe we should have put our new flat screen TV a tad higher up on the wall. - Or you could just suck in your stomach!
dr090115 -- - Can I try it?! - Sure, Patrick! - Just make sure you get the right amount of bubble fluid, and then hold the wand right about... - Yeah, it's pretty good.
dr090116 -- ...so like I said, if you get this message before ten, give me a... - CLICK! Hello?? - Darn! - I hate it when answering machines only give you 45 minutes to leave a message!
dr090117 -- I have to go in there and tell my teacher I lost my homework! - Don't just tell him you *lost* your homework! That makes you sound irresponsible! - Think of a better way to say it so he'll have sympathy for you! - I dislocated my homework!
dr090118 -- I'm sorry you're sick, dad! - I'm mostly concerned about your mother. - How come? - She worries a lot when I'm sick! - I sure hope you're not contagious because if *I* get sick and can't go to my *book club meeting* tomorrow night, I'm really
dr090118 -- gonna be *steamed*!!! - See what I mean?
dr090119 -- Look, dad! I found another dinosaur bone in our backyard! - That's not a dinosaur bone, Patrick! It's one of Wally's dog biscuits! - There goes my science project!
dr090120 -- RAWRFF! RAWRFF! RAWRFF! - Why does Wally always bark at you when you come home? - He's not barking! He's saying, "Ralph! Ralph!" - He knows my name! I thought his name was Grunthead!
dr090121 -- There's my kittie waiting to greet me! - I missed you! How is my favorite kittie? - I'm so happy to see you! - ...and also, hello to my beloved husband, who pays all the bills! Oh, yeah, hi Ralph!
dr090122 -- rake rake rake - rake rake rake rake - - Raking your own footprints out of a sandtrap is more difficult than it looks! Hurry up before it gets dark!
dr090123 -- Ralph, don't set your water glass on the table! It'll leave a ring! - And don't set it on my magazine! Use a coaster! - On second thought, that's a nice coaster... - How come you like to drink out of the hose, Dad. Life is easier this way.
dr090124 -- Wally, sit up! RARRF! - Lie down! - Roll over! - You didn't do anything right! I didn't see any treats!
dr090125 -- Ralph, I think you should get a physical. - I'm scared of doctors! - Besides, I know I'm in good health! - How do you know? - Because my friend No-Neck is the same age as I am, eats the same stuff as I do, and does all the things I do! - He
dr090125 -- gets a physical every year and he's always fine! If he's fine, I must be fine! - ...sigh... - How come she never says "good thinking, Ralph"?
dr090126 -- - - BLAT! thump thump - What made you think you could slice tomatoes with the ceiling fan? It was worth a try!
dr090127 -- - - Yipes! - Why didn't you tell me I looked ridiculous? I gave up in the mid-nineties!
dr090128 -- The kids are staying with Gramma tonight. - We have the house all for ourselves! - What could be better? Having the house all to MYself! - What did you say? That's wonderful, dear!
dr090129 -- I have an idea, Ralph... - Since the kids aren't home tonight, let's go to the video store and rent a movie we've been wanting to see! - There are no movies I've been wanting to see. - Fine! Then we'll rent a movie that I'VE been wanting to
dr090129 -- see! NO! NO! NO! I'LL THINK OF SOMETHING!
dr090130 -- Which of these movies should we rent tonight, Ralph? - That one! How come? - It's only 92 minutes long. The other one is 120! - Maybe I'll still have time to watch wrestling afterward!
dr090131 -- Ralph, I'd be happy to watch any movie! Just pick one! - OK, here! - - Pick any movie *except* this one! But this was Shemp's finest performance.
dr090201 -- I hate these gigantic hardware superstores! I have to walk miles to find anything! Holy crud! - Would you like a cart sir? - As a matter of fact, I would! Wheel me down to plumbing!
dr090202 -- Hello, Melanie? This is Norman Drabble. - I was calling to see if we're still on for tonight! - Well, I asked you for a date last summer, and you said you were tied up until Groundhog Day, remember? - Dang. I guess I should have touched base
dr090202 -- with her around Veterans Day!
dr090203 -- I understand. Thank you, anyway. 'Bye! - Sorry, Norman, but you'll have to clean your own room! - Even MIKE ROWE won't do it! Dang! Who's Mike Rowe? The host of TV's "Dirty Jobs." Do I have to explain everything?
dr090204 -- - I know that you're hoping that I'll drop some of this yummy cake on the floor, Wally... - But I don't like it when you sit there and look up at me with those sad eyes! - That goes for you too, Ralph!
dr090205 -- For me?? Wow! It's wonderful being married to me, isn't it, Ralph? - - Yes! - The correct answer is useless if your timing is off!
dr090206 -- Son, your problem is that you lie down on your back and let people walk all over you. - People never walk all over ME! - And why do you suppose that is? - Maybe they don't want to walk uphill! I WASN'T TALKING TO YOU!!
dr090207 -- ...so, my Dad was saying that... - Hey, are you using that chair? - This chair that I'm sitting in?? Yeah, can I borrow it= - Uh...well, sure. I guess so. - Anyway, my dad was saying that I let people walk all over me, but I don't think
dr090207 -- that's true. Do you?
dr090208 -- - - - - - - - OOF! - To jump all the way up on *this* stomach, you need a really good running start!
dr090209 -- ...Sigh... - If cats ruled the world, we wouldn't have beds... - Everyone would sleep on a pile of fresh laundry! Cats *don't* rule the world??
dr090210 -- pick pick claw claw Oogie! You bad kittie! - You clawed our new sofa to shreds! - Aww...I just can't stay mad at you! - Why not? You're able to stay mad at me! Oogie didn't buy me a vacuum cleaner for our anniversary!
dr090211 -- How was your golf game, Norm? - I was hitting my tee shots pretty well, but then I drove into the water on the 17th! - I drive a lot of balls into the water on that hole, too! - Not the ball, the golf cart!
dr090212 -- I need a favor, Norm. What is it, Stu? - I want you to go to Monique's house and ask her to be my valentine! - Why do I have to do it? Because I can't handle rejection! - And I CAN??! I figured you're an expert by now!
dr090213 -- Yes? Hello, Monique! - My friend Stu wants to know if you'll be his Valentine. - He's a little on the shy side, so he asked me to ask for him! - She said no. I KNEW I should have asked someone else to ask for me!
dr090214 -- Hi, Wendy. Will you be my Valentine? - Probably not. - OK, well, here's a box of candy, anyways! Thank you. - I'm glad I ate all the butterscotch squares!
dr090215 -- Allow me, honeybunch! - Don't worry about the dishes! I've got it all under control! - Let's watch whatever YOU want to watch! - Can I bring you anything, sweetheart? No, thank you. - Would you like me to fluff up your pillow? I'm fine. - I
dr090215 -- must admit, the first 24 hours after your husband realizes he forgot Valentine's Day can be pretty entertaining!
dr090216 -- Hey, Wally! Want to go outside and play ball? ? - I like how Wally tilts his head when he doesn't quite understand what you're saying! - Dad does that too sometimes, when Mom's talking to him! ...and when you buy the head of lettuce, pick out
dr090216 -- a *good* one! The ones in front are all picked-over, so reach for one in the back, but not the *bottom* of the back because it will be all squished... ?
dr090217 -- Hey Patrick, dad is so lame, he still doesn't know how to take a picture with his cell phone scratch scratch text text text - Send - Uh-oh! - I may be lame, but at least I know how to send a text message to the right person!!
dr090218 -- Wow! These 3-D glasses are *amazing*! - Everything looks so *realistic*!! - It's almost like I could reach out and touch things! Imagine how the movie will look when we get in the theater!
dr090219 -- Gee, this is interesting... - Apparently, future technology will enable us to send text messages to people in the past. - How do you know? Because i just received a text from myself in the future! - It says not to order the Pastrami Burrito
dr090219 -- or I'll regret it for days!
dr090220 -- Wendy, i wanted you to know that... - Uh-oh...it's another text message from myself in the future! - "Whatever you do tonight, don't tell Wendy that she looks good carrying a few extra pounds. - Never mind!
dr090221 -- WHERE'S THE CAT?!! - What? I thought I heard the cat yowling in here! - I couldn't hear a thing. I was singing along with my iPod! - That explains it. I should be danncinn' yeeeaaaaahh!
dr090222 -- - - - - BANG BANG BANG! * * bang! bang! * BANGITTY bang! bang! BANG BANG bang! bang! BANG! - You weren't going to cheat on your diet, were you, Ralph?? All I will say is, that was pretty sneaky to put bubble wrap in front of the refrigerator!
dr090223 -- One more bandage ought to do it. - Were you at least able to get the flea collar on? Almost.
dr090224 -- You seem a little down, Dad. - Don't worry. It's normal for a man your age to be depressed! - Add to that your other problems, like your expanding bald spot and your turkey neck, and it's all perfectly understandable! - Thanks for the pep
dr090224 -- talk, son. Now, go get 'em!
dr090225 -- I feel great this morning! - No you don't! I don't? - No! You're always complaining about your aches and pains! - Those aches and pains from 23 years of standing corrected!
dr090226 -- Uh-oh... - I'm receiving another text message from my future self! - It says, "never clip a clothespin in your nostril. It's very uncomfortable." - Boy, that arrived in the nick of time! Sigh
dr090227 -- Are you OK, dad? I'm nauseous! - No, you're *nauseated*! - If something is *nauseous*, it causes nausea in others. - He got it right the first time!
dr090228 -- Norman, do you really believe you're getting text messages from yourself in the future? - Of course! Only my future self would know these things! Listen... - "When you audition for 'American Idol,' don't sing '99 Bottles Of Beer On The Wall.'
dr090228 -- Even Paula won't like it!" - See?? Who else would have known I was planning to do that??

dr090620 -- When I open the front door, Wally will be there with a ball, waiting for me to come home and play with him. - How do I tell him that I've had a long day and I'm too exhausted to play? - - I don't.

dr090622 -- Sigh. - - Are you going to take some of EVERYTHING??! I've got to be home in bed by 11:30!! Patience is a virtue, especially in the buffet line!
dr090623 -- There are three things in life which are certain... - Death... Taxes... - And when I get home from work, Wally the wiener dog will be waiting for me with a ball to play with!
dr090624 -- When I come home and see Wally waiting for me with a ball in his mouth, I always wonder... - Has he been waiting here ever since I left this morning... - Or did he just come here, knowing that I always come home right about now? - It's a
dr090624 -- trade secret.
dr090625 -- I hate it when people leave fliers on my front door! - Gardeners, houses, housekeepers, coupons... - I hate the clutter! - Now, let's see what's in the fridge!

dr090629 -- Ralph, you fenderhead! What did I do now? - You ruined our calendar! You wrote "Golf With No-Neck" on July 7th, and took up the entire box! - There are five people in this family! Someone else might want to write something on July 7th, too! -
dr090629 -- Just when I thought I'd heard everything... Where's the whiteout?
dr090630 -- Hey, some kids are toilet papering our house!! - I'm going to scare 'em away! - - How'd that go? Not so good.
dr090701 -- - OOF! - - My new "Fat Blockers" work pretty good, don't they?
dr090702 -- Patrick, there's one thing all great athletes do to improve their game... - They study films! - I think we should do that, too! - I'm not sure watching *the babe ruth story* is going to help me! Are you kidding? William Bendix had a great
dr090702 -- swing!
dr090703 -- WOOSH - HIC! - WOOSH - HIC! - Never try to blow up a beach ball when you have the hiccups!
dr090704 -- Mom, what's for dinner tonight? Spinach casserole! - YUK!! - What's for dinner *tomorrow* night? *Leftover* spinach casserole! - Would you like to know what's for dinner the night after that? No, I think I'll just go live at grandma's house!
dr090705 -- What would you like for dinner tonight, Ralph? - Oh, I don't know... - How about that broccoli casserole dish that you like to make? - Really?? I always thought you didn't like my broccoli casserole! - I don't, but I've got a stuffy nose and
dr090705 -- I can't taste anything, so this would be the perfect night for it! - The thanks I get for trying to be helpful!
dr090706 -- Dad, is it better manners to put the ketchup directly on the french fries... - Or to dip each of them individually? - SKRAKK! - Say what? Never mind.
dr090707 -- Hi, honeybunch! - She's giving me the silent treatment. - What did you do? I wish I knew. - I'd do it more often.
dr090708 -- click! - WHIRRRR !  - You dumb cat! Why on earth are you afraid of a vacuum cleaner?? It's not like it's gonna... - AAAAAUUUGGHH!!
dr090709 -- Wendy, I have things going through my head... Besides air? - I'm thinking about our future together... - I'm thinking about the state of the world, I'm thinking about... - WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "BESIDES AIR"??!
dr090710 -- Are we there yet? Stop asking that! - It's annoying, and it won't make us get there any faster! - Patience is a virtue, and don't ever forget it! - Dinner ready yet?
dr090711 -- I'm having a bad day! I'm sorry. - Ralph, I hate it when you say you're sorry all the time! Sorry. - There you go again! Sorry. You need to stop doing that! - Sorry. You're gonna be sorry, all right!
dr090712 -- I'm home from work! - Hello, Wally! - I know you've been sitting here patiently waiting for me to come home... - But I'm too tired to play ball with you! - I work two jobs to make ends meet! By the end of the day, I'm too exhausted to chase
dr090712 -- you around the house trying to get the ball away from you! - So I'm sorry and I hope you'll understand, but... - GOT IT!
dr090713 -- Hey, Norm... - Hang on, dad! I've got three conversations going on here! - How does someone who can't walk and chew gum at the same time manage to text, E-Mail and talk all at once? Uh-huh...yeah... text text
dr090714 -- What time is it, Wendy? 12:25 DANG IT! - Everybody says a broken clock is right twice a day, but it's not true! - My watch is broken, and every time I check it, it says 6:52, which is never the right time! - I'll check it again in ten minutes
dr090714 -- and if it's still not right, I'm calling "Mythbusters".
dr090715 -- text text text text text No texting at the dinner table! - I'm your father, and what I say GOES! - Yeah, it goes through one ear and out the other! text text text text text ...Sigh...
dr090716 -- Dad, your problem is that life is passing you by. - You're a fuddy-duddy! You're a master of the mundane! You're simple-minded and boring! - Instead of your tired old ways, you should try a more creative approach! - You need to start thinking
dr090716 -- outside the box! You're going to be thinking outside the car, in a minute!
dr090717 -- My "listening" face. - My "I'm sorry" face. - My "oh, boy, we're going to your mother's house again" face! - My "concerned" face. - My "I love your new dress" face. - My "Sure, I'd love you to come play golf with me! face. - Every husband
dr090717 -- should take a little time to practice his faces!
dr090718 -- Look, Oogie! I bought you a toy! It attaches to your scratching post! - It wiggles, and you'll freak out because you'll think it's alive! Oh really... yawn - Exactly how dumb do you think I am?? - IT'S ALIIIIIIVE!!
dr090719 -- How war your golf game, dad? - Great! I ALMOST got a hole-in-hole! Wow! - Not only that, but I NEARLY got an EAGLE! Really?! - And I came THIS CLOSE to chipping it on the 11th! - And then I DARN-NEAR sank a 50-foot putt! - Way to go, dad! -
dr090719 -- You almost da' man!
dr090720 -- - - Have I mentioned lately how much I hate cats? Not since breakfast.
dr090721 -- You dumb cat! You got all wet! - Come with me! - CLICK! RRROOWWL! WHIRRR! AAAUUGH! - What happened? Never turn on a blow-dryer while holding a cat!
dr090722 -- GAAAAAAHHHH!! WHAM! - Whenever I get hurt, the dog always comes to me with concern! - The cat, on the other hand, just looks at me like I'm an idiot! - That's why dogs are better than cats! Actually, I just came over to see if he dropped any
dr090722 -- food!
dr090723 -- Here, Oogie! What's that? - It's a cat toy! Cats don't play with toys! - No cat would be dumb enough to play with a stupid thing like that! What do you think I am... - CLOMP! ...a dog?
dr090724 -- LOST CAT - White and orange. Has sharp claws, fleas, and sheds a lot. - If found, please keep! - Look who was hiding under the bed! Dang it!
dr090725 -- Bulk Club Membership Discount Warehouse It always takes a long time to check out at Bulk Club because everyone buys so much! - The good news is, they opened up an express line! - The bad news is, it's 75 items or less!
dr090726 -- Hi, honeybunch! - Honeybunch? Can you hear me?? - Oh, I see...you're listening to your iPod! - Well then, this might be a good time to tell you that I refuse to go to your sister's house next weekend! - I'M PUTTING MY FOOT DOWN! YOU CAN'T
dr090726 -- TELL ME WHAT TO DO! I'M THE MAN OF THIS HOUSE, AND THAT'S FINAL!! - Oh, hi Ralph! - By the way, we're going to my sister's house next weekend! Okeydoke! - Oh, be quiet! I don't say a word!
dr090727 -- Mom seems a little upset today, dad. That's because she thinks I've forgotten that our anniversary is tomorrow! - Why does she think that? Because that's what I want her to think! - Then tomorrow, when she's really mad, I'll give her this
dr090727 -- expensive watch, and she'll look like a complete fool! - How romantic! It's MY anniversary too! I deserve to have a little fun!
dr090728 -- Check this out, Norm! I bought your mom an expensive watch for our anniversary! - I even had it inscribed! - "To my first wife, honeybunch. Best regards, Ralph." - How's THAT for sentimental? It could've used a little more "mental".
dr090729 -- Norm, go find a clock and set your mom's new watch to the right time, but don't let her see it! OK! - Norman, it's trash day! AAAUUGH! - Well, don't panic! I just want you to take the cans out to the curb! Okie-doke! - I'd say he's acting
dr090729 --strangely, but with Norman, it's hard to tell.
dr090730 -- - That was a close one! The trash truck is on the way, and I almost forgot to take the cans out! - Where's the watch? What watch? - THE EXPENSIVE WATCH I BOUGHT FOR YOUR MOTHER THAT YOU WERE GOING TO SET FOR ME!! Uh-oh...
dr090731 -- Norman, where's the watch I'm giving your mom for our anniversary? I...I don't know! - It was in my hand, but then mom told me to take the trash out to the curb... ...I must have dropped it in the trash can! - No problem, dad! We'll just
dr090731 -- empty the can and we'll find it! No problem! - Problem.
dr090801 -- City Dump My son here accidentally dropped a very expensive watch in the trash! - It was an anniversary gift for my wife! Do you mind if we look around the dump and try to find it? - Are you kidding?? What are the odds of finding a WATCH in
dr090801 -- the DUMP?? - Then again, what were the odds of your son doing such a dumb thing in the first place?! In his case, pretty good!
dr090802 -- There's only one way to relax around here on a Sunday afternoon... - I'll need my reading glasses... - And a good book! - Now I'm all set! - Aw, isn't that cute? I'm less likely to get in trouble for being lazy if it looks like I fell asleep
dr090802 -- accidentally!
dr090803 -- This is hopeless! - Trying to find a lost watch in the city dump is like looking for a needle in a haystack! - Your anniversary is tomorrow! What are you going to give mom if we can't find the watch? - I wonder if she'd like a slightly used
dr090803 -- fishing pole?
dr090804 -- City Dump I give up. You must admit, dad, it's actually kind of funny! - You buy an expensive watch for mom, I accidentally drop it in the trash, and here we are, looking for it at the city dump! - I wonder if our insurance will cover it? - A
dr090804 -- lost watch? No, your upcoming medical bills!
dr090805 -- We'll never find it. The chances of finding your mother's watch in the city dump are slim to none! - Whoa! LOOK!! I don't BELIEVE it!! This is INCREDIBLE!!! - You found the watch??!! - No, somebody threw away a perfectly good Etch A Sketch!
dr090806 -- City Dump It's getting dark. We'll never find your mom's watch! - We've been here for hours sifting through trash. I'm exhausted and demoralized. - I give up. Let's go home. Dad, what if I discovered that mom's watch had been in my pocket this
dr090806 -- whole time? Would you be mad? - MAD IS NOT THE WORD! Remember, I said, "what if"!
dr090807 -- City Dump Dad! Look! I found mom's watch! That's impossible. - It CAN'T be the same watch. Read the inscription! - "To my first wife, honeybunch. Best regards, Ralph." - See? My name's not Ralph! IT SAID RALPH!!
dr090808 -- Happy anniversary, honeybunch! - You two smell TERRIBLE! - That's because we've been at the city dump, looking for your anniversary gift! - You got my anniversary gift at the CITY DUMP?!! - Yeah, and I also picked up a few things for myself!
dr090809 -- text text text text - text text - Oops! My bad! I hate texting!
dr090810 -- Honeybunch, would you like me to take you to see that stupid new chick flick? - The reviews are awful and it looks pretty dumb, but I'll suffer through it if you insist. - No, thanks. - Don't say I never offer to take you to the movies!
dr090811 -- - - - Your mom said I could have pancakes if I promised not to syrup on them!
dr090812 -- It says here that the key to a good marriage is to never tell your spouse what to do! - I never tell YOU what to do, do I? - - Answer me!
dr090813 -- - How was Woodstock? Hee hee! - Fine. How was the donut shop? - Smart aleck!
dr090814 -- Say cheese! I wish you hadn't brought that to the amusement park! - The camera adds ten pounds! - The backpack adds 25, the purse adds 15, the jacket adds five or six... We're going the roller coaster. Hold your Hats, too!
dr090815 -- How was your golf game, dad? - I shot seven birdies and two eagles! Wow! - What was your score? 103. - 103?? The back nine were brutal!
dr090816 -- Help me unload the groceries, Ralph... - I'm home from the store! - - - - - - You didn't come home FROM the store, you came home WITH the store!
dr090817 -- It's good to see you again, aunt Myrna! - Haa-CHOO! Whoa!! - Was that IT?? Was that WHAT, Penny? - Dad says aunt Myrna likes to shoot her mouth off!
dr090818 -- Everyone come out to the pool!! - And bring the video camera! What for?? - Dad's trying to get on top of the raft again!!
dr090819 -- The mail arrived! - Junk mail, junk mail, bills, junk mail... - Anything for me? Yeah, here... - "Recapture your youth with botox"??!! - My sense of humor is both a blessing and a curse!
dr090820 -- Hey, No-Neck! It's Ralph! I just realized that today is your birthday. - I forgot to send you a card, so I'll just read you one over the phone... - "Happy birthday to someone who is now old enough to drive with his blinker on!" - You're

dr090821 -- Patrick! Don't be afraid to bounce the ball off your head!! - It won't hurt! There's nothing but wait inside! - That goes for the BALL, too! - I'm going to deck this coach in a minute! Parents probably shouldn't come to the practices.
dr090822 -- It's the ninth inning and the pitcher has a no-hitter going! - This is really exciting! Even I'M nervous! - I can feel the butterflies in my stomach! - You're right, mom. Dad WILL eat anything!

dr090824 -- How was your first day back at the college, Norman? I'm off to a bad start, mom. - I already had to drop one class because it wasn't what I expected. - What class was that? The complete works of Ibsen. - I thought we'd be watching the
dr090824 -- Beverley Hills Billies and Barnaby Jones!
dr090825 -- chirp chirp! Whoa! I'm getting a text message! - Hello. The back of your head is cute. - text text text text - So is the front of your head!

dr090830 -- Boys, look at this bedroom of yours! I can't BELIEVE it! - It look s so much better! Thanks for tidying up! It took us all afternoon! I never knew we had a green carpet!
dr090831 -- Ralph, why do you like to barbecue so much? - It's a GUY thing, honeybunch! - Cooking meat over an open fire makes me feel 'at one' with my caveman ancestors! - I would think just looking in the mirror would do that! Before the night is over,
dr090831 -- I'll think of a snappy comeback!
dr090901 -- I know what you're going to say: you wish you had a new barbecue! - This one is getting old, and you'd like a fancy new one! - Christmas is coming. I'll keep it in mind! - My wife not only finishes my sentences, she often starts them!
dr090902 -- Ralph, come with me and close your eyes! I've got a big surprise for you!  - OK, you can look! - A new barbecue??! Are you happy? - I'll say! The last time you had a surprise, you painted the car orange!
dr090903 -- This new barbecue is easier to light than the old one, Ralph! - All you have to do is press a button! - You mean I no longer have to strike a match, toss it in and duck for cover? Correct! - Wow! Just think, maybe your eyebrows will grow
dr090903 -- back!
dr090904 -- I can't believe you bought me a fancy new barbecue, honeybunch! - How on earth could you afford it? - I used a credit card! - In other words, YOU bought it, and I get to pay for it! We make a great team, don't we?
dr090905 -- Honeybunch, I can't believe you bought me a new barbecue! - I love it! - How can I show my appreciation? How about a hug? - Okay!
dr090906 -- Why is Wally wearing a muzzle? - Because he always barks at other dogs and it's embarrassing! - Well, who can blame him? Some of these dogs are pretty ugly! Just look at THAT one! - Is that a dog or a SPACE ALIEN? - Yikes! Look at THAT one!
dr090906 -- Have you ever noticed how some dogs resemble their owners? -
dr090907 -- Now that you have a new barbecue, Ralph, you can throw away the old one! - I was thinking I'd sell it. It's still in pretty good condition! SELL it?? - You're funny! - The only time a man doesn't like to be told he's funny is when his wife
dr090907 -- says it!
dr090908 -- Hello, trash company? I need you to come pick up an old barbecue! - Yeah, I got a new one. It's pretty sweet, too! Three burners, side tables, a warming rack... - You've got a side grill on yours? Very nice! - Guys love to talk about their

dr090911 -- Norman, I told you to take the OLD barbecue out to the curb for trash pickup! You took out the NEW one!! - How could you have done that?? I'm sure it was an easy mistake that anyone could have made... - - Especially if it's dark and you're
dr090911 -- texting!
dr090912 -- City Dump Good evening, gentlemen! Hello, again! - My young son here accidentally threw away a brand new barbecue! Mind if we look around and try to find it? - I'm sorry, guys. I haven't seen anything like that around here! - Now, if you'll
dr090912 -- excuse me, I've got to go flip the steaks! - OK well thanks any...WHAT??
dr090913 -- - - - I can't walk through the house without being stared at by a pair of helpless puppy-dog eyes, hoping to be fed soon! - I wish animals could understand that it's not always supper time! - Animals and husbands!
dr090914 -- By the way, Ralph... - I'm sorry I've been so grouchy today. - How about yesterday? - I'm glad you don't work for the State Department.
dr090915 -- The boys' bedroom is a complete mess! - And it's spilling out into the hallway! - Norman! Patrick! Pick up all this stuff and throw it back in your room! - I've given up on their room. Now it's a policy of containment!
dr090916 -- My head tells me to use a 4-iron... - But my gut tells me to use my 5-wood. - I always follow my gut! - That's for sure!
dr090917 -- ...so it's the "Cash For CLUNKERS" program? - Darn! OK, thanks anyway! - I was hoping they said "Cash For Clickers"!
dr090918 -- Hi, neighbor! Steinbauer!! - Are you MOVING?? - No, I'm just throwing away a box of junk! - DANG!! Nice to see you, too!
dr090919 -- Hello? Hi. It's Wendy. - My other plans fell through tonight. - So I guess I can hang out with you after all. OK. - I guess I'm a human "Plan B"!
dr090920 -- shake shake shake - As an involved parent, I always volunteer to help with my son's soccer team! - Today I've been asked to stripe the playing field! - Unfortunately, the can of spray paint ran out. - Thank goodness I had some cheez whiz!
dr090921 -- We're having PANCAKES for dinner?? - No, I said we're having crab cakes! - YEECCCHH!! - For a brief moment, I thought I died and went to heaven! You could end up HALF right!
dr090922 -- Ralph, will you go turn on the dishwasher? I don't know how. - Don't know how?? We've had that dishwasher for 20 years! - All you do is turn the dial, push the button... - And then you have to give it a little bump, like this! That's the part
dr090922 -- I was worried about.
dr090923 -- I've been told I have a very fluid golf swing! - WHACK! - SPLASH! - No comment!
dr090924 -- - Are you just going to stare at that all day? - Yes! I'm so proud that I was able to repair the lamp! - Changing a light bulb is not exactly repairing a lamp!
dr090925 -- You're a pretty kitty, aren't you! I love you so much! - Let's go get some num-nums! kiss kiss kiss - Sometimes I think you like that cat more than me! - Only sometimes? Boy, I'm good!

dr090929 -- Have you and mom ever had your credit card stolen? - Yeah, once. That must have been terrible! - What did you do? - Nothing. The thief spends less than your mom!
dr090930 -- Penny, sometimes people say mean things! - Don't let it bother you! Do what I do... - I let it all roll off my back! - Wouldn't it be easier to let it roll off your STOMACH?
dr091001 -- Dad, I felt like I needed more privacy around here... - So I installed this chain lock on my bedroom door! - That's nice, son, but most people put those locks on the Inside! Even I knew that!
dr091002 -- Oh, you two are so cute! - Wait while I get my camera! - OK, act like you're having fun again! Taking the picture is easy. Staging the reenactment takes skill!
dr091003 -- I give up! - This is the hardest crossword puzzle I've ever done! - I thought it would be easy because some of the boxes are already filled in! - Dad, that's a Sudoku puzzle! Oh yeah. My bad!
dr091004 -- Boys, your rooms look great! - I've never seen it look so clean! - I know how hard it is for you to keep your room clean! - And when you do get it clean, it doesn't take long to get it messy again! - Anyway, good job, boys! - Oh, one more
dr091004 -- thing... - You were right, mom. That didn't take long!
dr091005 -- Looking for something, Ralph? Yeah, I've misplaced another pair of glasses! - Sometimes I think I'm losing my mind! If it gets lost, I know where to find it!

dr091009 -- Here you go! - ...sigh... - Boy, I hate raking! - Well, if you'd pick your clothes up off your bedroom floor once in a while...
dr091010 -- October is the best month of the year! - The worst month is January! How come? - There's nothing fun about January. The weather is bad and the December bills arrive. - January is so crummy, the super bowl moved to February!
dr091011 -- Why are you in THIS lane, dad? - It's the only lane that isn't moving! ...sigh... - Whichever lane I'm in always becomes the slowest lane by virtue of the fact that I'M in it! - Watch... - I'll move over to this lane, and... - Voila! - That's
dr091011 -- amazing! - How did you DO  that?? It's a natural talent. I can also do it at grocery stores, fast food restaurants and ticket windows!

dr091013 -- has the *2*! Let's not call the FBI just yet.
dr091014 -- - - SPLISH! - I hate taking eye drops!
dr091015 -- - - - I take it we're going to need another bag of Halloween candy. Never hurts to stock up!
dr091016 -- I heard on the news that people with larger thighs tend to live longer! - You should live forever! - The curse of a quick wit!
dr091017 -- - Ralph, what do you think you're doing? - Just having a little midnight snack, honeybunch! - At four in the afternoon? It's midnight in Europe!
dr091018 -- Barber - Hello, Ralph! - Just a trim today, Ernie! Okey-doke! - snip snip  - snip! - That'll be nine bucks! You know you're getting thin on top when the barber doesn't even bother to have you sit down!
dr091019 -- Hello, Mrs. Baker! I'm Norman, your hospital volunteer! Volunteer? - This week, everyone is being encouraged to become a volunteer-even totally inept people like me! - I've been asked to wheel you into the delivery room, so if you'll just hop
dr091019 -- on the gurney... - This isn't a gurney! It's not? DRABBLE!
dr091020 -- Boy, this elevator is nice and big, isn't it! - OK, let's see...what floor is the delivery room on? - I'll just push all the buttons and hope we get lucky! Here we go! - Whoa! The elevator seems to have stopped! What's up with that?? Of all
dr091020 -- the volunteers in the world, I had to get you!
dr091021 -- Mrs. Baker, I know you're anxious to get to the delivery room, but our elevator seems to be stuck! - I don't think the baby is going to wait!!! - Now what kind of an attitude is that? YOU'RE the parent! YOU decide when junior gets born! -
dr091021 -- Personally, I'd make him wait after Halloween! Hoo! Hoo!
dr091022 -- Have you ever delivered a baby before? I've never even CHANGED a baby before! - Well, since we're stuck in an elevator, you might HAVE to! - Let's remain calm. Everything will be all right. It's all going to be fine. Now, if you'll excuse me
dr091022 -- for a moment... - LET ME OUT OF HERE!!! Did I mention I'm expecting twins?
dr091023 -- PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!!! - SLAP! WAAAAAHH! - I'm sorry I had to slap you, but I'm trying to push the elevator door open as hard as I can! sniff!
dr091024 -- Well, how did your volunteer job go at the hospital, Norman? It was stressful, dad. - I got stuck in an elevator with a woman in labor. What did you do? - I did what any man would do under the circumstances. I passed out. - Fortunately, she
dr091024 -- climbed out the trap's door in the ceiling and summoned help, or I'd have been in there all day! Thanks for volunteering anyway, son!
dr091025 -- - - I think I finally outsmarted your dad! - Every year he finds my place for the Halloween candy, and then eats it all before the trick-or-treaters arrive! - This year, I hid it someplace he hasn't looked in years! Where? - O the bathroom
dr091025 -- scale!
dr091026 -- - - - Here Lies Ralph Drabble. I'm Sure The Cat Had Something To Do With This.
dr091027 -- How about this...when the trick-or-treaters ring the bell... - I'll open the door and go... - BLEAH! - No. I'm just trying to make use of the pumpkin guts!
dr091028 -- You sure waste a lot of time texting! - Not as much as other people do! - I literally spend half the time texting as everyone else I know! - That's because nobody ever answers me!
dr091029 -- I'm home! - Honeybunch, why are you painting the living room?? The trick-or-treaters will be here any minute! - I think I just answered my own question! I want my house to look nice for the neighbors.
dr091030 -- DING DONG - Only 55 days until Christmas! - Good grief! I haven't even started my shopping yet!! - I always know how to scare Mrs. Drabble! Good job! Here's an extra milk dud!
dr091031 -- What's going on? Mr. Drabble is letting us all come in and watch a scary movie! - What's so scary about their wedding video? DON'T DO IT, RALPH!! You're a riot.
dr091101 -- Hey, don't steal my Halloween candy, dad! - I'm not STEALING it, Penny, I'm SAVING you from it! - I'm saving you from a lifetime of cavities and calories! - As your father, it's the least I can do for you! - It's too late for me! I've lived
dr091101 -- MY life! But I can still make a difference in YOURS! - No thanks! Bring it back! I still need to dispose of a king-size peanut butter cup!
dr091102 -- ZZYZX! - Patrick - Patrick - Laser beams?? Too bad I have to resort to such extreme measures to protect my Halloween candy!
dr091103 -- 15...10...5... TOUCHDOWN! - WOO HOO! YES!! - It's bad enough that you two get so excited over a game... - But it was played 25 YEARS AGO!! Some people just don't appreciate the "Classic Games" channel!
dr091104 -- High fly ball into deep right field, she is...GONE!! YEAHH!! I don't understand why you like to watch those "classic" sporting events! - It's silly to get so wrapped up in something when you've already seen it, and know the outcome! -
dr091104 -- Frankly, my dear... ...sob... I could say something...
dr091105 -- I have the keyless remote, and I'm going to press the button... - HONK! - That means the cas is locked! - But I better do it again, just to be sure! One honk is never enough for some people! HONK!
dr091106 -- Directory - You Are Here - - How do they always KNOW??
dr091107 -- Directory You are here - - Directory Now you are here - Wow, modern technology is AMAZING!
dr091108 -- Norm, you were an eyewitness to a theft at the bookstore? That's right, dad. I saw the thief, plain as day! - I need to make a sketch of the subject. Can you describe him? Of course. - He looked like his name was Don. What kind of a
dr091108 -- description is THAT?? - Well, you know how some people look like their names? Yeah. - Well, this guy looked like his name should be DON! ...Sigh... - OK, let's see... - How's that? - No, that looks like a Harold! WILL YOU GET OUT OF HERE!!?
dr091109 -- Honeybunch, your birthday is coming up, so tell me: would you rather go to a nice restaurant... - Or would you rather just cook something special? - beep beep boop - Hi, Carrie! You'll never believe this one! You know you've asked your wife a
dr091109 -- dumb question when, instead of answering it, she calls her friends!
dr091110 -- I can't believe this, honeybunch! You bought low-fat milk, low-fat ice cream... - Low-fat cookies, low-fat potato chips, low-fat peanut butter... - What's NEXT?? - Hopefully, a low-fat husband!
dr091111 -- It's Veterans day! ! - - I said VETERANS day, not Veterinarians day! - That dog is just smart enough to be really stupid!
dr091112 -- I'm hungry. Dinner is coming up! - If it's your broccoli casserole, I'm sure it will be! - WAAH HA HA HA! - I'm on a roll! You're gonna be rolling, all right!
dr091113 -- - - FLASH! - Well, look who raided the fridge last night! I'm pretty sure this is unconstitutional!
dr091114 -- There's an empty chair next to that girl! Watch my smooth moves! - Hello! Mind if I sit down? Not at all! - PHHFFRRPP! - I have vinyl upholstery!
dr091115 -- I DON'T EVER WANT TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL AGAIN!! - Penny, stop being so theatrical! - THEATRICAL? I'm not being THEATRICAL!! - I'M NOT! I'M NOT! I'M NOT!! - - - - I'm NOT being theatrical!! Why did she leave and come back? Intermission.
dr091116 -- How about a kiss, Ralph? What?? - Give me a kiss! Really?? OK! - SMOOCH! - I KNEW it! YOU'RE the one who's been eating all my M&M's! I can taste them on your breath!! Dang.
dr091117 -- My friend Kathy is under the weather. - She lost her voice! She hasn't said a word for two days! Can you imagine? - Maybe you should pay her a visit! Good idea! - Try to shake hands with her a lot!
dr091118 -- - Oh, hi, honeybunch! - I was just about to do a little "pec-check"! - I thought you were about to admire your tire!
dr091119 -- What subject are you studying, Norm? - Politics. - That will be useful in life! - Especially if your kids play in little league!
dr091120 -- - - I hat it when I finish my magazine and I'm still not sleepy! - Me too! So, what would you like to talk about?
dr091121 -- I'm home! - - Relax, Wally! Don't overdo it! - Nobody understands dog sarcasm.
dr091122 -- Chicken...liver...lamb...beef... - What flavor of dog food do you think Wally would like? - Who cares? What do you mean, WHO CARES??! - If he doesn't like it, he might not eat it!! - Honeybunch, Wally is a dog! He likes anything! - Find
dr091122 -- something that tastes like my sweat socks! He REALLY likes those!
dr091123 -- No-Neck! Howdy, Ralph! - Here for dinner? No, I'm a buffet cop! - Buffet cop?? I watch for cheaters! - NO LEAPFROGGING! GET BACK IN LINE!!
dr091124 -- You're a BUFFET COP, No.Neck? That's right, Ralph! - There's something about a buffet that makes normally nice people become unruly! - It's a phenomenon known as "buffet rage." Excuse me... - SALAD TONGS ARE NOT WEAPONS, PEOPLE!!
dr091125 -- Well, well, well! Looky what we have here! What is it, No-Neck? - You filled your WATER glass with SODA! That's a serious buffet violation! - I must have pressed the wrong button! I THOUGHT this water looked a little bubbly and orangy! - Too
dr091125 -- bad! I have to add it to your tab! It sure TASTES watery!
dr091126 -- TWEET! - A FLAG ON THE PLAY! 15-YARD PENALTY!! - You were fishing all the chicken out of the chicken noodle soup! That's a buffet violation! - A 15-yard penalty?? That will put you back at the end of the buffet line, Ralph!
dr091127 -- Bye, No-Neck. Hold it, Ralph! You didn't leave a tip for your busboy! - Busboys work hard to keep your table neat and clean! - Don't be such a cheapskate! - All right, I'll go back and leave a few bucks on the table! - If I can find room!
dr091127 -- It's proper to tip the buffet cop, too!
dr091128 -- So long, No-Neck! NOT SO FAST, RALPH! - Are you attempting to leave this establishment with a MUFFIN? All food must be consumed on the premises! - What else are you trying to abscond with? UP AGAINST THE WALL!! - Well, well! Look who has a
dr091128 -- pocket full of lava cake! I hope you know I intend to fill out a customer satisfaction card!
dr091129 -- - - - - - - - SNARF! - Sorry about the cake, but I'm only human! You could've fooled me!
dr091130 -- So, let me guess... - You got on the scale and saw that you lost a few pounds! If that's not reason to celebrate, I don't know what is!
dr091201 -- Ralph, you bought the wrong paper towels! These are AUTUMN PRINT! See the leaves? - It's December! We need the WINTER PRINT with the snowflakes! - That's the last time I sent you to the store for me! - Mission accomplished!
dr091202 -- I think the correct answer is 578! - ...or maybe it's 12. Dad, will you please help me with my homework? - Oh, yeah. Sure. - Dad helps by not helping!
dr091203 -- I did it!! - I finally finished a daily crossword puzzle! - I feel so smart! What a feeling of accomplishment! - Dad, none of the three stooges was named "Glrph". Close enough!
dr091204 -- Ralph, I have to leave. Please feed Oogie! - Mix some cat food with the leftover chicken, and put three drops of milk on top! - Then put it into the microwave for exactly 4 seconds. No more, no less! - Good luck! Why can't you just find a
dr091204 -- mouse, like all the other cats?
dr091205 -- Ooogie didn't eat the cat food?? Did you follow my instructions? Yes. - Did you add the chicken? Yes. Did you add three drops or milk? Yes. - Did you put it in the microwave for exactly four seconds? Yes. - Did you turn ON the microwave?! Oh,
dr091205 -- crud! If I starve to death, it'll be his fault!
dr091206 -- I wish we could get a whit tree this year! Me too! - Then why DON'T we? You mom wants a green one! - But why can't we get what YOU want? Son, let me explain something... - The key to a successful marriage is compromise. - For example, I like
dr091206 -- to sleep with the window open. Your mother likes to sleep with it closed. So we compromise... - We always sleep with it closed! - Do you get what I'm saying, son? I think you're saying we're not getting a white tree!
dr091207 -- Daddy, what's a "nanosecond"? - It's one-billionth of a second, Penny! - Thanks, Mom! - It's also the length of time it takes my wife to answer a question directed to me!
dr091208 -- STEINBAUER! What are you doing??!! Decorating for Christmas, Ralph! I'm shaping the hedge between our yards to say NOEL! - But from MY side, it says LEON! Who cares?! Don't be such a scrooge! - I never met a man I didn't like, but Steinbauer
dr091208 -- receives honorable mention!
dr091209 -- KNOCK KNOCK! - Cookies! - Look, Ralph! Someone left Christmas cookies on our doorstep and ran away! - Aren't people wonderful this time of year? Don't touch it! It could be a trap!
dr091210 -- Somebody left cookies at our door! Let's have some! - No! We don't know who left them here! They could be tainted! Why would anyone leave us tainted cookies? - As a high-profile law enforcement official, I have enemies! - Dad has a high
dr091210 -- profile?? He certainly has a WIDE profile!
dr091211 -- Someone left cookies on our porch. They could be tainted. - I'll be the guinea pig and eat the first one! - AAACKK!! - Are they tainted?! Inconclusive. I'll have to eat another!
dr091212 -- These cookies aren't tainted, Ralph! Look, there's even a note! - "Enjoy the cookies! We'll be leaving a treat at your door every night until Christmas! -Your secret Santa." - "Secret Santa"?? So, what do you all have to say NOW? - I say we
dr091212 -- hide in the bushes tomorrow night to see who it is! Yeah! We could drop a net over them!
dr091213 -- I love coming to the buffet, honeybunch! - T do too, Ralph. - The only problem is that you tend to overeat! Don't worry... - I've devised a new strategy! - Ad soon as my stomach touches the edge of the table, I'll know it's time to stop
dr091213 -- eating! - CRASH! BREAK! WHAM! SMASH! - I think you should stop now! Sorry. I guess that was one too many chocolate-chip muffins!
dr091214 -- We're so lucky, Penny! Our family has a SECRET SANTA! - Every night until Christmas, someone is going to leave goodies at our front door! - But we mustn't try to see who it is, or it will spoil the fun! Isn't it exciting?! - I'll hide in the
dr091214 -- bushes, you guys hide behind the trash cans! Roger! Some of us might be a little TOO excited!
dr091215 -- What a waste of an evening! - We hid outside to catch our secret Santa, but no one ever showed up! Yes they did! - They left a plate of brownies at our BACK door three hours ago! - Our secret Santa outsmarted us! THIS MEANS WAR!
dr091216 -- Someone is approaching our house, dad! It could be our secret Santa! Roger! - GOTCHA!! - False alarm. It was just Norman getting the mail!
dr091217 -- Our secret Santa is approaching our front door! - WE GOT HIM!!! - STEINBAUER?? Season's greetings to you too, Ralph!
dr091218 -- Steinbauer! YOU'RE our secret Santa??! - YOU'RE the one who's been leaving goodies at my front door every night?? That's right, Ralph! - I thought, what better way to enjoy the holidays than by showing kindness to someone I don't like very
dr091218 -- much! - What's there not to like about ME?? Well, take this net, for example.
dr091219 -- Daddy, when I grow up, I'm going to marry someone just like you! - Really, Penny? That's nice of you to say! - Only he's going to be taller and smarter and a little better looking! - OK, well, that's still nice of you to say! Actually, a lot
dr091219 -- better looking!
dr091220 -- - - - - - - Hey, don't pull the popcorn string out of the Christmas tree! - GIVE ME THAT!! Humans love to play. You've just got to find the right toy!
dr091221 -- The mail arrived! - Oh look! My mother sent a Christmas card to Oogie! - She did WHAT??! Look, Oogie! Isn't it adorable?! - There are three stages of life: youth, middle age , and I-send-Christmas-cards-to-cats!
dr091222 -- Arf arf arf! Arf arf arf! Arf arf arf! Arf arf! - SLAM! - I told you we should've sung "silent night". Not everyone enjoys the barking version of "Jingle Bells"!
dr091223 -- You kids did a fine job of decorating the tree this year! - Bob makes an excellent tree-topper! I should have migrated when I had the chance!
dr091224 -- Come on, Norm! It's your turn! - Hurry up! - Look! A see a red light in the sky! It must be Rudolph! Aren't we getting a little old for this? Yes, but your dad isn't!
dr091225 -- Thanks for all the gifts, mom and dad! I can't believe how much we got! - When's easter?
dr091226 -- Dear Mr. Claus, - It has come to my attention that you left one less item in my stocking than you left for my brothers. - I'm sure it was just an oversight and that you will want to rectify it a.s.a.p - Penny, I'm so proud of you for writing
dr091226 -- your thank-you notes early! A pair of socks does not count as two items.
dr091227 -- - I hate these plastic bags! - WHIFF-IFF-IFF - I can never pull them apart! - RIP! - And then I can never get them open! - RIP! tear! tear! shred! shred! RIP! - I'll bet that's why most people don't eat enough fruits and vegetables!
dr091228 -- Dear aunt Wanda, thank your for the nutcracker. - When we told you we like nutcrackers many years ago, we never expected that you'd give us one every year! - We now have more nutcrackers than we have NUTS to CRACK! I'm SICK of them!!! - On
dr091228 -- second thought, I'll write the thank you notes. I was just getting warmed up!
dr091229 -- I'm writing a thank you notice to Bruce and Pat! - Five pages?? That's not a note, that's a term paper! - Isn't that a little bit long for a thank you notice? - Of course, I'm talking to someone who leaves 20-minute messages on answering
dr091229 -- machines!
dr091230 -- Good boy, Ralph! - This ice cream has been here for a week, and you haven't touched it! - Congratulation on your self-control! - Actually, I've replaced it five minutes!
dr091231 -- Are you making any new year resolutions, Wally? - I'm going to quit barking my head off every time I hear a knock at the door! - I resolve to become less superstitious. - ...knock on wood! Arf! Arf! Arf! ARF! Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf! ARF!
dr100101 -- It's a cold, windy day for a parade! - Hurry! Tie the rope around his leg!! I am not a runaway balloon!
dr100102 -- OH, for heaven's sake! - We have a new television, but I'm afraid to turn it on! - It seems like there's always something violent and bloody on every channel! - May that's why they're called plasma TVs!
dr100103 -- What did you lose now, son? - I can't find my library card! - Oh, for Pete's sake, Norm! You need to become more responsible! - You're getting to big for this! - You're always losing things! It shows a lack of focus! - Take CARE of your
dr100103 -- things! Remember, there's a place for everything, so keep everything in its... - By the way, I found your car keys in the refrigerator! - Sometimes I'm glad that my kids tend to ignore me!
dr100104 -- Dad, I got into a little fender bender. - But I have a good excuse! - I was texting. Why is that a good excuse? - It's hard to do two things at once! My son, the crash-text dummy!
dr100105 -- My new year's resolution was to stop barking my head off whenever someone knocks on the door! - How's it going? - So far, so good. - Nobody's knocked on the door!
dr100106 -- Gulp! - crick! - RATTA-TATTA-TAT - It's always a little painful to get the December credit card bills!
dr100107 -- There's nothing like putting on a warm pair of sweatpants! - As soon as they cool off, I like to throw them into the dryer and heat them back up! - That's fine when you're at HOME! Ahhhh! LAUNDROMAT
dr100108 -- I got a 99 on my exam, dad! Good for you, Patrick! - Did YOU ever get a 99 on an exam? - Sure! Many times! - Having your temperature taken is not an exam. Then no.
dr100109 -- Norm! I thought I told you to take out the trash! - Don't worry, dad. I'm all over it! - The only thing he's ever been all over is the furniture!
dr100110 -- Dad, I've been doing a lot of thinking... - So I'm going to lie down for a while! That's my boy!
dr100111 -- Ralph! Come quick!! What's wrong? - Oogie is stuck in a tree! - She can't get down! She can't come inside! - Aren't you going to DO something?! I was considering a cartwheel!
dr100112 -- I know how to rescue Oogie! I'll call 911! Don't do that, honeybunch! - Why not? If we don't, we might never see Oogie again! - Honeybunch, the paramedics are too busy helping injured people! They don't have time to rescue a dumb cat! -
dr100112 -- Besides, why mess with a good thing?  Maybe when they come here to help YOU, they'll rescue Oogie, too!
dr100113 -- How will we get Oogie down from that tree, mom? - I have an idea: Oogie always comes running when I turn on the can opener! - WHIRRRRRR - My mistake. It's your father who always comes running! What are we having??
dr100114 -- Honeybunch! What are you DOING?? If YOU won't rescue Oogie, *I* will! - OK, OK...I'll get the stupid cat out of the tree! - Dad, I insist you be careful! Hold on tight and don't fall! - But let me get the video camera just in case!
dr100115 -- Almost there... - The ladder is bending! - SNAP! - Hisss! What a cheap ladder! I'll be taking it back to the store!
dr100116 -- I can't believe our ladder broke in half! What poor quality! - Don't worry, Ralph! I'm going to take it back to the hardware store and make them replace it! - I'll wait here. bat bat Keep Oogie company!
dr100117 -- Supermarket Honeybunch, I think I'll buy these new diet pills I've seen advertised on TV! - Careful, Ralph. Always check the label first for any possible side effects! - Sometimes the side effects are worse than the problem! - "Side effects
dr100117 -- may include irritability, hairloss, watery eyes..." - "insomnia, muscle ache, join pain, gas, bloating, lethargy, thirst..." - !itchy skin, nausea, excessive sweating, dizziness, blurred vision, drowsiness, and feelings of inadequacy and
dr100117 -- helplessness." - Perfect! I've already got all those things, anyway!
dr100118 -- Why are you sitting in a tree, Ralph? - If you must know, Steinbauer, I climbed up to rescue our dumb cat, and the ladder broke! - That's too bad! Would you like to borrow *MY* ladder? Yes! I'd LOVE to! - Well, you never returned my socket
dr100118 -- wrench, so tough tacos! What a guy! Hiss!
dr100119 -- What luck. I climb up here to rescue our stupid cat, and the ladder breaks! - Now I can only sit here and wait for my wife to get another one! pick pick purrrrrr - What could be worse than being stuck in a tree with only a cat? Tweet! I had
dr100119 -- to ask! Grrrr!
dr100120 -- SWIPE! - Good news, dad! Mom took the broken ladder back to the store and they replaced it! She's on her way home! - Tell her to step on it!! This cat is obnoxious! I have to get done from this tree before I go insane!!! - She says it's too
dr100120 -- late for that! My wife puts "art" in SMART ALECK!
dr100121 -- Dad, I have an idea! - I'm throwing a rope over the branch above you... - OK! Are you ready? FOR WHAT? - Actually, I'm not exactly sure yet! The five words that frighten me the most: "Dad, I have an idea!"
dr100122 -- Put Oogie in the kitty carrier, ad I'll lower her down! - Kitty carrier?? Isn't that the box we use to take Oogie to the vet? - WAIT! DON'T LET HER SEE THAT BOX OR SHE'LL GO... - RIP! SHRED! CLAW! SCRATCH TEAR! SLASH! - Ballistic.
dr100123 -- I'm back with the ladder! - Hey! You're out of the tree! When it started snowing, the additional weight caused our branch to break! - Fortunately, Norman had time to shovel a giant snow pillow beneath me to cushion my fall. Was I really gone
dr100123 -- that LONG? - I almost fell bad that I stopped to get my nails done!
dr100124 -- RING! Hello! Drabble Residence! Patrick speaking! - ...Norman? No, he can't talk right now! - His tongue is caught in an ice cream scooter! AN EXTHPLANATION ITH NOT NETHETHARY!
dr100125 -- ...oh, that's too bad. I'm sorry to hear that they're not getting along. - Ralph and I have a rule in our marriage... - We never go to sleep angry! - Isn't that right, Ralph? Wha...?
dr100126 -- RRIPP! YEEOOWW!! Thanks, guys! - OK, but the next time you get a lint roller stuck on your hairy back, don't call 911! I thought he was wearing an Alpaca sweater!
dr100127 -- Turn left at Ernie's Donuts. - Turn right at Jose's Pizza, and left at Pancake Palace. - Make a legal u-turn at Fred's Frozen Yogurt. Then veer left at Tiny's Tacos. - You have an interesting GPS! Slow down! There's the pancake house! It gets
dr100127 -- me where I want to go!
dr100128 -- KNOCK KNOCK - BARK BARK BARK BARK BARK BARK BARK!! - Relay, Wally! We've never had an evil intruder knock on our door! - I must be doing a good job!
dr100129 -- Let's see what my fortune cookie says... - A partner's hip will prove to be exciting. - - Oh, my mistake... "A PARTNERSHIP..."
dr100130 -- You should enjoy these years, mom. - Before you know it, I'll be all grown up!
dr100131 -- Norman, you dress like a nobody! You need to sell yourself a little better! - What do you mean, dad? Well, take this for example...what am I holding? - An apple? Wrong! - It's a RED DELICIOUS apple! It says so at the store! - Notice how they
dr100131 -- didn't call it a RED SO-SO apple, or a RED FAIRLY TASTY apple! It's a RED DELICIOUS apple! - Do you understand what I'm saying, Norm? - No. ...Sigh... - In a world of red delicious apples, my son is a kumquat!
dr100201 -- I don't understand it... - My mother looks bad in every one of these photos! - And what don't you understand about it, exactly? - Wives: They want you to communicate, then they don't want you to communicate!
dr100202 -- - - - I don't see any warpath, dad!
dr100203 -- Norm, some people are "Type A" personalities. They are driven to succeed! text text - Other people have "Type B" personalities. They are slightly less ambitious! - What type of personality am I, dad? It's hard to say, Norm. - The alphabet
dr100203 -- only goes down to *Z*! text text
dr100204 -- Don't take this the wrong way, Ralph... - I know how defensive you get whenever I offer a little constructive criticism. - So don't get all bent out of shape and act like a baby like you always do, all right? - We haven't even gotten to the
dr100204 -- CRITICISM yet!
dr100205 -- - - - Why, exactly, DO you watch these medical shows? The surgical procedures are fascinating!
dr100206 -- Kendall's dad works for a sporting goods company. He always brings his kids cool stuff from work! - Did you bring ME anything home from work, dad? - Patrick, I'm a security guard at a retirement village! - ...Sigh... - Here! I found a set of
dr100206 -- false teeth!
dr100207 -- ...and that concludes the first half! - - SLAM! - - SLAM! - - SLAM! - During the super bowl, we don't play musical chairs, we play musical bathrooms!
dr100208 -- ZZYZX! - Hey, Wally! Wanna play ball? - Wiener dogs: if you've seen one, you've seen 'em all! It sure seems that way sometimes!
dr100209 -- My skin is looking old and wrinkly! - - - No, it isn't! That was MUCH too late!!
dr100210 -- How does the mall directory always know where I'm standing?? - Oh, wait...I get it! - Sorry! I guess that was one of my dumber questions! - Actually, that's not even CLOSE to being one of your dumber questions!
dr100211 -- I'm feeling a little light-headed! - That's understandable. - - There's not much in there to weigh it down! I GOT IT ALREADY!
dr100212 -- - pat pat pat pat - Does this look like a pancreas to you? Close enough. When Patrick builds a snowman, he goes a little overboard.
dr100213 -- Happy Valentine's Day, Honeybunch! - Marrying you was the best decision you ever made for me. - That's probably not good, either! In the long run, dad, BUYING a card might be less expensive!
dr100214 -- Patrick! Look at this highschool picture of dad! - That's DAD??? - Wow! You were really in shape back then, dad! - You better believe it, boys! - In my younger days, I was a chick magnet! - Now he's a refrigerator magnet!
dr100215 -- Here's a box of valentine candy, Norman! Foe ME?? Thank you, Wendy! - I had an extra one and I couldn't find anyone else to give it to. How thoughtful! - The mailman is on a diet, the guy in the toll booth is allergic... I'm touched! - Hey,
dr100215 -- maybe my insurance agent would like it! Thank you for thinking of me momentarily!
dr100216 -- Who is Babe Ruth?!! - Sorry, honeybunch! I know it's rude to blurt out answers while watching "Jeopardy." - That's OK, Ralph. - You're never right, anyway! The correct answer is: "Who is Ghandi?" Dang!
dr100217 -- An empty ice cream carton?? - Ralph, did you forget about your diet?? You're not supposed to eat ice cream!! - I didn't eat it, honeybunch! That's true, Mom! - He put it in the microwave and drank it!
dr100218 -- Here's the mail, honeybunch! Is that all? - Yes. I threw away all the junk mail! - If you threw away all the junk mail, how come you didn't throw away this ad inviting me to join a weight-loss program? - Do you think I'm fat? This would be a
dr100218 -- good time to fake an appendix attack!
dr100219 -- Ralph, you said you threw away all the junk mail... - But you DIDN'T throw away this ad inviting me to join a weight-loss program. - I'll ask you one more time: do you think I'm fat? - Uhhh... The correct answer to that does not begin with
dr100219 -- "uhhh"!
dr100220 -- Ralph, I'm going to ask you only one more time... - Why did you give me this ad for a weight-loss program?? Honeybunch, I can explain. - HONK! HONK! HONK! Whoa! Our car is honking! I'll go investigate!! - Now I know why they put the red
dr100220 -- button on the keyless remote!
dr100221 -- Hang on a second, Meg! Ralph is leaving for work! Bye, Ralph. Bye, honeybunch! - Hold on, he's back! Sorry! I forgot my wallet! - He always forgets something! Bye! - Oh, my gosh! He's back again! Forgot my cell phone! Sorry! - He is SO
dr100221 -- middle-aged! Bye! - OH, FOR CRYIN' OUT LOUD! Forgot my lunch! - - Something wrong, dad? I'll give you a dollar to go inside and get my car keys!
dr100222 -- The kids are all gone, Ralph! Huh?? - Norm is at the movies, Patrick is at a birthday party, and Penny is at grandma's! - Do you know what that means? We have the house to ourselves! - I think it also means I'm not going to get to watch
dr100222 -- wrestling tonight! We can play a board game or take a walk or watch a chick flick or...
dr100223 -- Since it's just two of us tonight, Ralph, let's play a game like Parcheesi! PARCHEESI?! - How about if we just watch a little TV? OK! Let's see what's on! - Oh, I love this interior design show! And there's  a love story on the classic movie
dr100223 -- channel! - Parcheesi it is! Oh, the bachelor show is on!!
dr100224 -- We have the house all to ourselves, Ralph! Just you and me! Isn't this fun?!! - I'm having the time of my life. I win again!!
dr100225 -- Isn't it fun having the house all to ourselves, Ralph? Let's play charades! Oh no... - DING DONG Someone's at the door! I'll get it!! - Steinbauer!! How the heck are you? Thanks for dropping in!! - Actually, I'm just here to complain about
dr100225 -- your dog. Whatever! Come on in and sit a spell!
dr100226 -- Hasn't this been a fun evening, Ralph? Games, movies, conversation... - This is what it will be like when our kids grow up! Just the two of us together every night! - We're home! - DON'T EVER GROW UP!!
dr100227 -- clip clip clip Ralph, for heaven's sake! - Are you trimming your toenails while you're eating dinner?? - I prefer to think of it as multitasking!
dr100228 -- ...Sigh... Do you have a box or something? Maybe you should empty your pockets BEFORE you bring your clothes to the cleaners!
dr100301 -- Welcome to Wobbly Heights Retirement Village! - I'll be glad when the repairman gets here!
dr100302 -- Before I head for home, I'd better listen to the traffic report! - All freeways are clear, except for the Harbor Freeway, which is jammed! That's good to know! - Honeybunch said if I'm late, she's going to the opera without me. - The Harbour
dr100302 -- Freeway, it is!
dr100303 -- Every time you go to the store, you sure buy a lot of stuff! - Do we really NEED all of those things? - you have to distinguish between WANTS and NEEDS! - Take this ice pack, for example... Oh, you're going to need it, all right!
dr100304 -- - - ...Sigh... - I always know how to get my kids off the computer!
dr100305 -- Happy birthday, honeybunch! - I must say, you look much younger than you really are! - Thank you, Ralph! - I must say it, or else!
dr100306 -- When I was a kid, my favorite show was "Gilligan's Island." - I always wondered why they had so many clothes, when they were only on a three-hour tour. - I think I finally figured it out. - Your mom must have packed for them! I hope I haven't
dr100306 -- forgotten anything! We're going to be gone overnight!
dr100307 -- text texty text text! - Pssst! Stop that! - It's not polite to send text messages in church! - It's disrespectful! - What would your mother say if she looked over here and saw you doing that?? Why, she'd probably... - Never mind! text text
dr100307 -- text!
dr100308 -- Well, it's the start of another little league baseball season... - A time when a big career is the dream of every child. - ...and quite a few of their parents! Swing level, keep your eye on the ball, and remember that the average major
dr100308 -- league salary is over $3 million!
dr100309 -- Patrick, if you're going to be a baseball player, you'll need all the proper accessories! - First, you'll need to get some of this black stuff to put on your cheeks! - What for? So the glare doesn't get in your eyes and cause you to drop the
dr100309 -- ball! - But if I DON'T use it, at least I'll have an EXCUSE for dropping the ball! Good point. Let me think about that...
dr100310 -- Come on, Patrick! Get it over the plate! - I think you're being unrealistic, dad! I just can't do it! - Keep trying! Do you know how much money a left-handed pitcher can make??! - I KEEP TELLING YOU, I'M NOT LEFT-HANDED!! That's why you need
dr100310 -- to keep practicing!
dr100311 -- Here's another great thing about little league season... - It gives us the opportunity to get to know other parents! - People we might not otherwise have gotten the chance to know! - Like that windbag down the street, or the raving lunatic
dr100311 -- around the corner, or the dirty rotten cheater across town...
dr100312 -- I know we can improve your little league team, Patrick... - Make a trade for that kid named Longville! He's really good! - His dad's the coach of his team! What kind of dad would trade away his own son?? - I did, once. And I've never forgiven
dr100312 -- you!
dr100313 -- STRIKE THREE?? - THAT PITCH WAS A MILE OUTSIDE, UMP!!! - YOU NEED GLASSES, YOU... I'm back from the snack bar! - Phffmmf! There's a reason baseball and hot dogs go together!
dr100314 -- Let's go! We're going to be late! It's almost nine o'clock! - Really? It doesn't seem it's nine o'clock! That's because I set our clocks ahead one hour last night! - You did?? I set them ahead an hour, too! - I couldn't remember if we were
dr100314 -- supposed to move our clocks UP an hour or BACK an hour, so I moved some of them up and some of them back. - I couldn't remember, either, so I just set them all ahead twenty minutes! - I hate it when daylight-saving time begins! Don't worry.
dr100314 -- We usually get it all straightened out by mid-april! I hope it's still Sunday!
dr100315 -- OK, I picked up the dry cleaning! - Let's go! I'm in a hurry! Sorry, dad. We can't leave yet. - Why not? Because I parked in a space that said "30 minute parking only". - We've only been here four and a half minutes! WILL YOU START THE CAR!!
dr100316 -- HALT! WRONG WAY! - This is an EXIT! If you try to enter on this side, you'll receive severe tire damage! - I don't see anything that could cause tire damage! Suit yourself! - KA-BLAM!
dr100317 -- Honeybunch, in honor of St. Patty's Day, let's have some IRISH for dinner! - OK! How about corned beef and cabbage? No, not that! - I mean TRADITIONAL Irish food! - You know, like McNuggets, McRibs, Sausage Mc Griddles...
dr100318 -- What's on the TV, Norm? - Nothing. - Then why are you staring at it? - What's in the refrigerator, dad? Nothing.
dr100319 -- Ralph, it's ridiculous that you spend so much time standing in front of the refrigerator, just staring inside! - You know, she's right! -
dr100320 -- I think I'm losing my mind! - Has anyone seen my glasses? I can't find my glasses!! - You're not losing your mind. They're right on top of your head! - Those aren't mine! OK, maybe he IS losing his mind!
dr100321 -- Sorry, honeybunch, but I just can't take you to see that new chick flick! Why not? - I don't have the stomach for it! - - - - - - You've got the stomach for ANYTHING!! I knew she'd never be able to make it through the day!
dr100322 -- Say what you want... - I've heard all the arguments... - If that's not evidence of global warming, I don't know what is!
dr100323 -- What's new, No-Neck? - My doctor says I need to slim down. - But, instead of going on a diet, I've decided to just hang around people who are more out of shape than I am! - So, where are we going now? WILL YOU LEAVE ME ALONE?!!
dr100324 -- I may not be perfect. - But at least I can say one thing... - I'm a self-made man! - You should've asked for some help!
dr100325 -- I'm home! - Aaaaahhhh! sniff sniff! - There's nothing like the aroma of freshly baked cookies! - Unless it's "Freshly Baked Cookies" scented air freshener!
dr100326 -- You men do such a fine job of guarding our community! Have a cup-cake! - Thanks, Mrs. Alabaster! No thank you! - Trying to loose weight, Ralph? Not really... - At this point, it's more of a matter of damage control!
dr100327 -- After a hard day at work, it's nice to be greeted at the front door by our faithful dog! - I'm home! - And your point is...? Being greeted by the cat is not quite the same!
dr100328 -- I'm gonna throw the ball, Wally! - Go get it! - Hee hee! - ? - - It's fun to fake out a dog! - Well?! Why are you just standing around?? You acted like you needed to go for a walk outside! I'm getting drenched! It's fun to fake out people,
dr100328 -- too!
dr100329 -- I'll have a cheeseburger, hold the onions, please! - Onions give me bad breath! - You already have bad breath! - OK, then DON'T hold the onions!
dr100330 -- Mustard on your french fries?? What a loser! - Did she just call you a LOSER? - I thought she called me a LUGER, which I didn't understand because I've never done the luge! - "Loser" makes much more sense!
dr100331 -- I can't believe you just called him a loser! - It's OK. He likes it. No I don't! - Well, I guess "loser" IS a little harsh! - From now on, I'll just call you a pathetic dimwit. Thanks for your help!
dr100401 -- Excuse me...why are you so rude with him? - Yeah, why ARE you so rude to me? He doesn't deserve that! He's a nice guy! - I AM a nice guy! He's reasonably intelligent! - My GPA is 2.6! YOU KEEP OUT OF THIS!
dr100402 -- You're very rude to him! I am not! - You should appreciate him! Mind your own business! - You ought to be ashamed of yourself! Oh, I get a life! - ARE YOU GOING TO LET HER SPEAK TO ME LIKE THAT??
dr100403 -- Fine! I'm leaving! Good riddance! He deserves to be with someone who appreciates him! - Thank you for sticking up for me! No problem. - Say, would you like to hang out with me sometime? Hmmm...let me think about that... - No. I hate it when
dr100403 -- they think about it!
dr100404 -- - - - - - Oh, hi, Wally! I almost forgot about you! - You're overdue for booster shots! I'll go call the vet! - This is why dogs get into the garbage and drag it all over the house!
dr100405 -- I need to get in shape. I'd go jogging, but it's so boring! - A lot of people jog with cell phones or iPods... - Take something with you that makes it more enjoyable! Good idea! - Mini Donuts
dr100406 -- Dad, you're a gate guard at a retirement village, right? Right. - How come a gate guard's hat is shaped like this? Believe me, there's a very good reason! - WHAM!
dr100407 -- - - - Thanks for helping me clean up after my book club meeting! Always a pleasure!
dr100408 -- RING! RING! RING! - HOW COME NO ONE EVER ANSWERS THE PHONE AROUND HERE?? - All our friends call us on our cell phones, dad! - The only people who call on the house phone are people we probably don't want to talk to! Good point!
dr100409 -- - This is painful! Maybe I should stretch before I jog! - OW!! - Apparently, I need to stretch before I stretch!
dr100410 -- Gadzooks! - RIP SHRED TEAR - There's a humongous springtime blowout sale at the fabric store! - When will I stop believing letters that say "Urgent! Open immediately!"??
dr100411 -- DING DONG! - wheeeee - wheeeee - chirp chirp! pick claw scratch shred - click! whirrrrrrr! - wheeeeeee... - - Mobile Cat Groomer Frisky cats like Oogie require special precautions! No wonder the groomer charges so much!
dr100412 -- Bob! Long time, no see! Where have you been? - On my annual migration to Rio de Janeiro! - Although, I may have gone the wrong direction again. - This time I ended up at a Brazilian restaurant in Utah! You're the only duck in the world who
dr100412 -- needs a GPS!
dr100413 -- Patrick is coming up to bat! - Every time my son comes to bat, I go stand in my lucky spot! - STRIKE THREE!! - I'm running out of lucky spots!
dr100414 -- Paper or plastic? - Neither. - I'm wearing my cargo pants!
dr100415 -- Norman, slow down! You're eating too fast! - Patrick and Penny eat fast, too... - Why do all of my children eat so fast?? - HEY! MY FRIES ARE GONE!! Oh, yeah, huh!
dr100416 -- Hey, the garbage pail is full! There's no room for my trash! - Perhaps you should do something about that, son! - I guess I'll have to! - There! I took out the bulky stuff!
dr100417 -- I've been having a lot of self-doubt, lately. - On second thought, maybe I haven't!
dr100418 -- You know, Ralph, sometimes in the quiet, early morning hours, I think about our kids... - And I marvel at how well they're turning out! - I can't believe how nice they all are! - I think about how much joy they bring to our lives... - And I
dr100418 -- think about how lucky we are! - But then they wake up! YOU are No, YOU are! Stop it! He used my toothbrush! Don't push! MOM!! That's mine! Stop touching me! OW!!
dr000419 -- The car is packed! We're ready to leave on our trip to visit grandma! - Good heavens! I forgot about our pets! What about them? - We'll be gone of a week! Who will feed them? - They know where the garbage cans are! They'll be fine! Maybe

dr000421 -- M&M's in the cushions! THOSE ARE MINE, TOO!!
dr000422 -- Hey, Ralph, your dog wasn't eating his dog food, so I fed him the steak that was in the freezer! You WHAT??!!! - Steinbauer, that was top sirloin!! I was saving it for the weekend!! Oops! - Did you give him ALL of it?? No, just a little! - I
dr000422 -- ate the rest! GAAAHH!
dr000423 -- Listen , Steinbauer, I know we hired you to be a pet sitter... - But I think you're spending too much time at our house! I don't appreciate you helping yourself to all my stuff! - Relax, Ralph! I'm not even at your house right now! I'm
dr000423 -- playing golf! - By the way, do you have any extra balls in your golf bag? I keep hitting them in the lake!

dr100428 -- What are you doing, Penny? - I'm working on my thumb speed! Huh?? - I need to be able to text faster so I won't get in trouble at school! - Perhaps you just shouldn't text in school! Or I could just work on my thumb speed!
dr100429 -- Shame on you, Ralph... - I told you to start watching what you eat! - What happened? - My eyes got tired!
dr100430 -- I hate it when they play 911 calls on the news! - It's an invasion of privacy. People are calling in a state of panic or grief! - It's just not right! - Help! This is Norman Drabble! I'm head's stuck in a mailbox! Besides, That doesn't even
dr100430 -- sound like me!

dr100506 -- I like u, Norm! text text text Really?? What do u like about me? text text - I like how you can't keep your shoes tied...I like how your hair is always a mess.. - I like how you always smell like peanut butter...I like that dumb look on your
dr100506 -- face... text text text - I could go on and on... text text text That's OK. text text text
dr100507 -- Maybe we should hang out together sometime, Nrmn! text text text - When? text text text How about tonight? text text - K! What time? text text Pick me up in 2 hours. text text text - That will give me time to recharge my cell phone! text text

dr100510 -- ...17 minutes, 31 seconds...17 minutes, 32 seconds... - I'M NEVER GOING TO MAKE IT!! - What's wrong with dad? He's having a physical tomorrow morning. - The doctor told him to FAST for 12 hours! Why do they call it a "fast" when the time goes
dr100510 -- so slow?!
dr100511 -- This is ridiculous! I can't go 12 hours without food or drink! - Dad, I know it seems hard, but it's important to follow the doctor's orders! - You can do it, dad! I'll help you every step of the way! - It'll be a piece of cake! CAKE?!!!
dr100512 -- Dad, a blood test is an important part of a physical exam... - That's why the doctor asked you to fast for 12 hours. - If you've been eating before the exam, it could affect the results. - That could explain why last time they said your
dr100512 -- blood type was "Oreo-positive"!
dr100513 -- The doctor says dad has to fast for 12 hours before his physical exam! You can do it, dad! - It's probably my imagination, but I already feel a little thinner! - Just think how you'll look in ANOTHER two hours! I think I need a new belt!
dr100514 -- I don't care what the doctor says! I can't fast anymore! - A little midnight snack won't hurt! No one will ever know! - Let's see what's in the pantry! - AH HA!!
dr100515 -- I did it!! I fasted for 12 hours, like the doctor said! I'm off to my physical! - Ralph, the doctor called. He had to reschedule your appointment for tomorrow! - That means you'll have to start fasting again tonight! - In that case, I'd
dr100515 -- better have a substantial breakfast!
dr100516 -- Hi! I'm calling to tell you that Timmy just got a great hit! - It was incredible! You wouldn't believe it!! - HE CLOBBERED it! He nearly tore the COVER off the ball!! - Timmy hit a ROCKET that they had NO CHANCE to catch! It was AWESOME!!
dr100516 -- Everyone went WILD!! - TIMMY POPPED IT UP AND THE INFIELDER COULDN'T CATCH IT BECAUSE THE SUN WAS IN HIS EYES AND HE WAS CRYING!! - Baseball parents have never been known for their journalistic integrity! Ignore him. That's the pitcher's dad!
dr100517 -- Welcome To Wobbly Heights Retirement Village STOP - All Laws Strictly Enforced. -
dr100518 -- Good morning, Mrs. Alabaster! - This is for you! Why, thank you, officer Drabble. - I'm sorry it's late! - Do you know how hard it is to find a belated 100th birthday card?
dr100519 -- You need some exercise, Ralph! - What are you talking about?! - I'm getting plenty of exercise! - My head's spinning, my heart's racing and my stomach's churning!
dr100520 -- Honeybunch, I have a stupid question... - There's no such thing as a stupid question, Ralph! - Are these MY sweatpants or yours? - There my be no stupid questions, but there are certainly ill-advised ones!
dr100521 -- Here's my report card, dad! - ...Sigh... - Just remember, times have changed. - A "D-Plus" is the new "B-Minus"!
dr100522 -- WALLY! HERE, BOY! - - Here, kitty, kitty, kitty! - The best way to get the dog to come here is to call the cat! !
dr100523 -- CLOSED?? - I don't get it! It doesn't make sense! - How could a donut shop that had YOU for a customer, ever go out of BUSINESS??!! According to the sign, the owner retired to the French Riviera!
dr100524 -- GAS - For all the money they charge us for gasoline... - You'd think they'd at least provide squeegees that work!
dr100525 -- scribble scribble - Look, honeybunch! I did it! - I finally completed the daily crossword puzzle! - How many boxes did you have to blacken-in? JUST A FEW!
dr100526 -- - Hey! I think I can see a can of... - No, maybe not. - ...Sigh... I keep telling you, Ralph, no matter how long you stare into the refrigerator, nothing's gonna change in there!
dr100527 -- When you stare into the fridge for a long time... - and don't see anything good to eat... - it helps to close the door for a few seconds. - Yes! It works every time!
dr100528 -- Ralph, this card is very sweet! - My mother will love it! - I'm surprised you'd buy her such a sentimental birthday card! - They don't make funny cards for people her age!
dr100529 -- Hi, Wendy! - Mind if I sit here? - Sorry. That seat is taken by my imaginary friend! - Aren't you going to introduce us?
dr100530 -- Ralph, this is ridiculous! - I'm tired of having one dinky little inflatable pool in our backyard! - It's too small for us all to swim in! - You're right, honeybunch. I guess it's time to shell out some money so my family can swim in style!
dr100530 -- - Much better! I won't even bother asking him about a room addition!
dr100531 -- I'm home from work! - Good morning, dad! - It's 5:30 p.m.! Whatever! - I see summer vacation is off to a flying start!
dr100601 -- Now that the semester is over, I'm going to sell my textbooks back to the school book store! - They'll pay top dollar for used books in good condition! - If you bring back a book that looks worn and heavily used, they won't pay you as much. -
dr100601 -- I'm guessing that won't be a problem for him!
dr100602 -- Campus Bookstore End Of Semester Book Buyback! I'd like to sell back my text books. OK. - Let me examine them to make sure they're in good condition!... - You highlighted every word in this book with a marker! - I wasn't sure what I needed to

dr100709 -- lose their glasses!
dr100710 -- Honeybunch, look at this comic strip! - I think the cartoonist may have misplaced his glasses! Why? - It doesn't look quite right. - Actually, I think it looks better than usual!

dr100812 -- Dad, I have a golf tip for you. What's that, son? - Try not to hit or lose your ball all the time! - It not only adds strokes to your score, but it gets expensive! - Why didn't I ever think of that? Maybe I should be an instructor.

dr100831 -- Norm, as you prepare to leave home to go live at college, you may be having second thoughts. - But let me remind you of one thing... - Today is the first day of the rest of my life! - That's nice, dad. Maybe I could turn your room into a home
dr100831 -- theater!
dr100901 -- We always knew the day would come when you left home, Norman. - You poor father is taking it very hard! - I even saw a tear in his eye! - Actually, that's just sweat from moving the pool table into my room! Oh yeah, huh!
dr100902 -- I'm going to miss you, big brother! Me too! - You're the best big brother in the world! What about me? - You're the ten BILLIONTH best big brother in the world! Well, you're the ten ZILLIONTH best little sister! - MOM! PATRICK IS BEING MEAN!!

dr100907 -- So, what's your major, Norman? I'm still undecided. - What do you want to do for a living? I'd like to be a LEGO sculptor! - A LEGO sculptor? Yeah! Check out this amazing likeness of Abe Lincoln! - It looks like a battleship! Really? Wow, I
dr100907 -- have even more talent than I thought.
dr100908 -- How about you, Elgin? What are you studying? I'm a music major. - I aspire to become a professional vuvuzelist! - BOOVVVVVVV! - Catchy! I hope my practicing won't keep you awake at night!
dr100909 -- I can't believe Norman has left home! - What an adjustment! It already seems so different around here! That's true... - Hey! Who tracked in mud?! Uhhh... - It must have been you! Now there's one less person I can blame things on!
dr100910 -- I can't believe our oldest child has left home! Before you know it, we'll be emptynesters! - Patrick, don't ever grow up and leave home, OK? - You mean you want me to never become self-reliant and mature? You want me to be dependent on my
dr100910 -- parents forever? - If you wouldn't mind! Let me get back to you on that!
dr100911 -- It's strange... - Norman hasn't even been gone a whole day, and the house already seems different! - I know... - Instead of having 3 TVs on with nobody watching them, we only have *2* TVs on with nobody watching them!
dr100912 -- What flavor are you going to get, dad? Hmmm... - How about chocolate? Absolutely not! - Strawberry? Nope. Bad idea! - Orange? Peanut butter fudge? Nope! No way! - Better make it banana! Banana?? - Why banana? The color of my yogurt always has
dr100912 -- to match my shirt!
dr100913 -- Norman has only been gone since this morning, but I already miss him! Me too, honeybunch! - By deciding to live at college, at least he's proven that he's growing up! - - What are YOU doing back here?? Since college isn't that far away, I
dr100913 -- figured I'd sleep here at night!
dr100914 -- Norman, you can't sleep here every night! We've already paid for your dorm!! - Grow up and show some independence! - Let go of your mom's apron strings! - And let go of my sweatpants strings, too!
dr100915 -- Norman, you can't sleep here every night! We've already paid for your dorm! - But I've never slept away from home, dad! - I'd never be able to sleep at college! - You sleep at college all the time! Yeah, but that's in the daytime!
dr100916 -- ...and then they lived happily ever after. - Goodnight, Norman! - 'nite, dad! Of all the roommates I could have gotten this semester, I had to get him!

dr100923 -- them with a new bag, thinking I wouldn't notice?! - Trust me, she'll know!
dr100924 -- An old flame sent me a Facebook message. It's best to let sleeping dogs lie, Ralph! - You're right! I'll ignore her 'friend' request! Smart man! - I'll click 'ignore' right now! Here I go! I'm going to click 'ignore'! Ready,

dr110125 -- Face it, guys, we're the biggest losers in the entire college! - Girls won't even make EYE CONTACT with any of us! So what are we gonna do?? - Son, don't be shy! Let the world know you're there! Don't be afraid to make a fool of yourself! - I
dr110125 -- just remembered some advice my dad gave me right before I got thrown in jail. Oh boy...
dr110126 -- OK, guys, I did a little shopping! Here you go... - One for Leonard, one for Stu, one for Elgin... - What ARE these? Our new costumes! - COSTUMES?? Trust me, we're about to become EX-losers!
dr110127 -- Blue bodysuits? With masks! Let's put 'em on! - We'll wear them to all the basketball games! We'll cheer and act crazy! Everyone will love us! - For the first time in our lives, we'll be the center of attention! - C'mon, guys! There's a game
dr110127 -- tonight! We look like a bunch of giant kumquats! Kumquats aren't blue! No, but they're stupid-looking!
dr110128 -- Arena Gate B Ticket, please...thank you! Enjoy the game! Ticket, please... - My ticket? Let's see...where did I put my ticket? - This skin-tight body-suit doesn't have any pockets! Where could I have possibly... - Oh, yeah...here it is! Just
dr110128 -- keep it!
dr110129 -- Hello? ...oh, hi, Norm! What's up? Dad, do you remember when you told me to be more outgoing? - Yeah. Well, turn on the TV! I'm at the college basketball game, dressed in a blue bodysuit! - We're going to act wild and crazy! OK, but remember:
dr110129 -- I'm now the exalted ruler of the Polecat Lodge... - Don't do anything to make me look silly!
dr110130 -- Honeybunch, what's... For dinner? Spaghetti! - You know, I need to... Talk to me about something? OK, go ahead. - I don't like the way... I finish all your sentences? You're right. That's not very nice. - Why... Do I do it? I'm not sure! But
dr110130 -- I'll try stop doing it. - Good. I'm... Glad we had this conversation? Me too. I'll try harder. - Thank... You? You're welcome! - Why am I not optimistic about this?
dr110131 -- These blue bodysuits were a great idea! Look at all the attention we're getting! - From now on, everyone will know who we are! - That's right, Leonard! I'm Stu! I thought *I* was Stu!
dr110201 -- Our seats are at the very top! How can we entertain the crowd from way up here?? - We could start a wave! Great idea! Let's do it! - OK, PEOPLE! WE'RE GOING TO DO A WAVE! WHEN I COUNT TO 3, EVERYBODY STAND UP AND CHEER! READY? 1...2...3!! -
dr110201 -- WAP! I don't think they want to do a wave!
dr110202 -- One, two, three... - YAAAAYY!! - Look! It worked!! People are on their feet! We started a wave!! - WE'RE NOT LOSERS ANYMORE!! Oops...we kicked over our sodas! What the...
dr110203 -- Look! We finally started a wave! People are on their feet!! Sweet! - Except most waves go around and around the arena. Our wave is going straight down! - We invented the VERTICAL WAVE!! HEY, WHO SPILLED THEIR DRINKS BACK THERE?! MY PURSE IS
dr110203 -- RUINED!! MY NEW SHOES!!
dr110204 -- Here in the arena, the crowd is doing a VERTICAL WAVE started by four blue dudes in the top row! - You idiots! You spilled your drinks all over the place!! Jerks! - My purse is ruined! My new shoes are soaked. LET'S GET 'EM!! YEAH!! - And now
dr110204 -- the blue dudes are being lifted up and tossed around! Clearly, the crowd loves them! That's my boy!
dr110205 -- C'MON! LET'S GET OUT OF HERE BEFORE WE GET KILLED!! - Hey, you blue dudes are the best! Huh?? - How did you get the crowd so ramped? I wish WE could do that! - You're cute!! Are we actually being spoken to by cheerleaders????
dr110206 -- I've got soda and pretzels! - I've got the chips and dip! - And I've got the cheese and crackers! - I've got everything we need to make sandwiches! - I've got the candy and popcorn! - OK! Let's all get comfortable and watch the Super Bowl! -
dr110206 -- I can't see the TV! This must be why people buy big screens!
dr110207 -- You guys really excited the crowd! Who ARE you?? You blue dudes are very mysterious! Wanna hang out with us? Gulp! - COME BACK HERE!! Why did they run away?? I think I'm in love! Let's follow then!!
dr110208 -- Let's get out of these costumes! - I'm not sure if wearing those blue suits to the game was a good idea or a bad idea! - Where did the blue dudes go?? They were awesome! I hope they come to all the games! Wow! Everybody LOVES us!! If I ever
dr110208 -- see those blue idiots again, there's gonna be trouble!
dr110209 -- Look, guys! They're showing clips of the game on TV! - During the game, four fans in blue body suits thrilled the crowd by starting a VERTICAL WAVE! - THAT'S US!! WE'RE THE BLUE DUDES!! Yeah, right! Sure you are! No way. Get lost! Shut up! In
dr110209 -- your dreams!
dr110210 -- SKRAKKK! - tie tie twist tie - My dentist said to use dental floss every day! !
dr110111 -- When I was a kid, I used to HATE rainy days! - I hated not being able to go outside and play! - Something tells me a rainy day doesn't bother kids like it used to! Is it still daytime?
dr110212 -- I hope I never become the oldest person in the world! - How come? - Because it seems like every day, there's an article that the oldest person in the world dies. It must be very stressful!
dr110213 -- I'm starving! Let's pull into a drive-thru up ahead! - Ralph... I'd like a ten-piece box of chicken nuggets... - Ralph. Quiet, honeybunch. It'll be your turn in just a second! - Now, where was I? Oh yeah...and an order of curly fries. - I'm
dr110213 -- sorry. We don't have that! - You don't have CHICKEN NUGGETS and CURLY FRIES?? What kind of place is this?? This is a drive-thru pharmacy! - I know I told you to be quiet, but now I think I'd just like you to laugh at me and get it over with!
dr110214 -- Why did I wait until the last minute?! The valentine cards are all picked over! - Hey, there's a good one! - LET GO! No, YOU let go! I saw it first!! - Any man can BUY his wife a card. I FOUGHT for yours!
dr110215 -- Look, guys! It's those cheerleaders who flirted with us at the basketball game! Let's go talk to them! - Are you kidding?? We're not wearing our blue costumes! They don't know who we are!! - Without the costumes, we're just a bunch of nerds!
dr110215 -- - The correct term is a "School" of nerds! I thought it was a "gaggle" of nerds!
dr110216 -- Those cheerleaders loved us when we wore our blue costumes at the basketball game... - Let's introduce ourselves! No way! Without our costumes, we're just nerds! - Might I remind you that the nerds are the leaders of tomorrow! Good point,
dr110216 -- Elgin! - Let's come back tomorrow!
dr110217 -- - SCOOP! - THUD! - Would you like jelly on that peanut butter sandwich? No thanks, I'm on a diet!
dr110218 -- We've got rabbits in our yard again! - I know how to get rid of them! I'll put some lettuce and carrots out there! - But dad, if you do that, you'll attract every rabbit in the neighborhood! Don't worry... - I'm going to put it in
dr110218 -- Steinbauer's yard!
dr110219 -- Wiener dogs are so funny! FUNNY??! - I resent that remark! Wiener-dogging is serious business! We protect the house and chew up things that need to be chewed up! - We must be constantly alert! Nothing distracts a wiener dog from... - CAT!
dr110220 -- Maybe I'll watch a little TV! - Hmmm...it's on channel 2 right now... - But I want to watch channel 54. - I could walk all the way across the room and get the remote to change channels the easy way... - Or I can just stand here and push the
dr110220 -- "up" button 52 times! - push push push push push push - push push push push SIGH! - Maybe I'll just watch whatever's on channel 18! You are officially the laziest human being on planet earth!
dr110221 -- What in the world... - Look at all these empty ice cream containers! - Neopolitan, Rocky Road, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough... - So, how's your diet going? It's been much easier than I expected!
dr110222 -- Yes, I'm sticking to my diet just fine, honeybunch... - Look! I'm even drinking a glass of water! - As I drink more water, I find that I no longer crave fattening treats! - Why are there nine empty ice cream cartons in our trash can? SPPFFF!
dr110223 -- I'm very disappointed in you, Ralph! Honeybunch, I have not been cheating on my diet! - I don't know where all these empty ice cream containers came from! - Maybe they just fell out of the sky! - KLUNK!
dr110224 -- STEINBAUER!! What? - Why are you throwing your empty ice cream cartons into MY trash can?? - Because I'm supposed to be on a diet! If my wife sees them, she'll get mad! But now MY wife thinks I'M cheating on MY diet!! - Do you mean to tell me
dr110224 -- that you're afraid of your wife?? No, but...WAIT A MINUTE!
dr110225 -- Come on, Steinbauer! You're going to tell my wife the truth!! - Honeybunch, our next-door neighbor has a confession to make! - Jun, I'm the one who's been putting the empty ice cream cartons in your trash can! - And you expect me to believe
dr110225 -- that? No, but he does! IT'S TRUE!
dr110226 -- Ralph, do you honestly expect me to believe that MR. STEINBAUER put those ice cream cartons in our trash can??? Good grief! - She didn't believe us! Now what should we do? -
dr110227 -- ...sigh... What? - Don't tell me you're going to sit around all day watching bowling on TV again! - What's so bad about that? - You need more exercise! - Maybe she's right! - I'll watch tennis instead!
dr110228 -- Sigh! - Oh, you want me to move out of the way, don't you? - I can tell by that heavy sigh and the look on your face. - Nothing gets by me! Especially in the hallway!
dr110301 -- Ralph, will you please rinse the dishes? ME?? - Yes, you! It's not that complicated! ...Sigh... - Sometimes I wonder if you intentionally do things wrong so I won't ask you again!
dr110302 -- I love putting on these blue suits and going to the basketball games, Leonard! - Yeah, people seem to really like us, too! - Who would've thought that all we had to do to become popular was cover ourselves from head to toe! We should've
dr110302 -- thought of it sooner!
dr110303 -- OK, blue dudes! Let's hold up our signs and cheer on the team! - GO!! WIN - "Not in the shouts and plaudits of the throng, but in ourselves, are triumph and defeat." -Longfellow #1 You put way too much thoughts into your signs, Leonard!
dr110304 -- OK, guys! Let's hold up our signs!! - GO TEAM! WIN! - SCORE! Sorry. I had writer's block!
dr110305 -- That was a great game! The crowd loved us again!! You said it, Norman! - HEY, BLUE DUDES!! WAIT!! - I want a picture!! Wendy??! - I'd love to know who you guys are! No you wouldn't!
dr110306 -- knock knock knock OH NO! THERE'S SOMEONE AT THE DOOR!! - HELP!! WALLY, DO SOMETHING! SOMEONE'S AT THE DOOR!! - WELL?? AREN'T YOU GOING TO BARK?? Excuse me? Aren't you the ones who get upset every time I bark at the door? - You always scold me
dr110306 -- and yell at me to be quiet, and now you WANT me to bark?? - We were wrong, Wally! Please forgive us! We NEED you! Yawn! Very well... - roff roff roff roff roff roff roff! Our hero! - woof woof woof I wonder what dogs dream about?Something
dr110306 -- stupid I'm sure!
dr110307 -- There's a new restaurant in town, honeybunch! Want to go to dinner? - I'd love to! Wait here! I'll go change. - What king of place is it? - I don't know, but kids eat free!
dr110308 -- Hey! It's the blue dudes!! - Can I have your autograph, Mr. Blue Dude? Certainly! - Remember, young man, study hard and get good grades! - For future reference, 'dude' is spelled d-u-d-e!
dr110309 -- OK, blue dudes! Let's show some spirit! - Hey, wait a minute... 1,2,3,4... - We have an extra blue dude! - One of you guys is a FAKE! Gee, I hope it's not me!
dr110310 -- Who ARE you?? You're not one of us!! Can I be a blue dude, too? - No! You can't just show up in a blue outfit and become an official blue dude! No way! Absolutely not!! That's final!! - Please? You guys are cool! - Oh, OK! SLAP! YES!
dr110311 -- I can't believe a stranger joined our "Blue Dude" squad! - Face, it, we've become popular at these games! We've been on TV and in the newspapers! - Heaven only knows who's going to wanna' join us next! DAD?? Hi, Norm! Need another blue dude?
dr110312 -- WHIRRR... - WHIRRR... - WHIRRR! - I sharpened all your pencils for you! And a couple of pens!
dr110313 -- I'm making my favorite sandwich. - Peanut butter and jelly... - topped with potato chips and chocolate chips! - It's a recipe I invented myself! - Who knows, if I keep this up, you may one day see me on the Food Network! - Or on "The Biggest
dr110313 -- Loser". Wait, I forgot the bacon!
dr110314 -- Look, honeybunch! The flowers are starting to bloom... - The trees are getting green again, the sun is getting warmer... - Kids are flying kites and playing baseball! Do you know what that means? - It's time to put away the Christmas music!
dr110314 -- OK, but just until labor day!
dr110315 -- - - CLOMP! - The wiener dog is the natural enemy of the water bottle! crunch crunch!
dr110316 -- Hello. I saw your ad on TV! - I'm calling for a free quote! - OK, thanks. - What did they say? "A fool and his money are soon parted."
dr110317 -- I'm home with dinner! - FAST FOOD? - I thought you said we were going to have IRISH food in honor of St. Patty's Day! We are! - Here's your filet-o-fish!
dr110318 -- I'm telling you, honeybunch, we'll make a fortune... - Every man likes cargo pants! That may be true, Ralph... - But I'm not sure anyone would by a cargo TIE! You sure like to rain on my parade!
dr110319 -- Leave a message at the beep! Sigh... - Hello! Pick up the phone, Dorothy! I know you're there! You're screening your calls, just like I do! - If you don't pick up, I'm going to be very insulted! - It's poetic justice when a call-screener
dr110319 -- becomes the screenEE! OK, I'm starting to get upset!
dr110320 -- I'm always pumped up before one of our games! Me too, Stu! - I always have butterflies before I suit up! - Who would've thought that one day, thousands of adoring basketball fans would actually cheer for us? Amazing! - Let's go, guys! It's
dr110320 -- showtime! - HEY! IT'S THE BLUE DUDES!! Can I have a picture? DE-FENSE! WE'RE #1 - Can I have an Autograph? You guys want free hot dogs?
dr110321 -- THWOK! - There is no such thing as a bad day on the golf course! - CRACK! BONK! CRASH!! OWW!!! - But today deserves honorable mention!
dr110322 -- Don't be afraid! You can do it! - You were born to fly high and straight! Don't ever forget that! - I've heard of a horse whisperer, but I've never heard of a golf ball whisperer! C'mon, baby! I believe in you! Find the fairway!
dr110323 -- Oh, why me?? - As soon as you hit me, I'll be lost forever! No one will ever find me! - And I can't swim, either! - Shut up, you stupid ball! I think this game is finally getting to him!
dr110324 -- There's a big basketball game tonight, honeybunch! - I'm putting on my blue bodysuit so I can join Norm and his fellow blue dudes! - I'm sure the fans will appreciate your support! - They'll also appreciate your decision to wear sweatpants!

dr110326 -- Here's an idea, Norm...when the other team has the ball, let's all shout "Air ball! Air ball!" Good idea, dad! - AIR BALL! AIR BALL! AIR BALL! AIR BALL! - WAP! I think we're getting to them!
dr110327 -- Hop in the car, Patrick! It's time to go to school! - Mom, I don't feel well. I think I should stay home today! - You don't have a temperature... - What are your symptoms? - Well...I'm not really sure. I just feel like I shouldn't go! - Nice
dr110327 -- try, Patrick, but you're not getting out of going to school! - I'M NOT TRYING TO GET OUT OF GOING TO SCHOOL!... - I was trying to get out of dad's day to drive the carpool! So, who wants to hear my Johnny Cash impression again?
dr110328 -- CHOP! - Hitting golf balls is a great way to take out my frustrations! - What makes you frustrated? Hitting golf balls! CHOP!
dr110329 -- Ralph! Guess what! What?! - My mother is coming over tonight! - That news wasn't deserving of a "GUESS WHAT"! "Guess what" should only precede GOOD news! - So what should I have said? "Sit down. I have something very bad to tell you..."
dr110330 -- - - What do I have to do to get noticed around here?? I'd like to enjoy my pork rinds in peace!
dr110331 -- Forget it, Wally. Staring at me with those big, sad eyes won't make me share my pretzels! - Cocking your head real cute like that won't work, either! - Oh, for cryin' out loud! Here! - Dogs practice this stuff when you people aren't home!
dr110401 -- Look, Wendy... - My shoelace is untied! - HAW HAW! SLAP! - Wait! That's not how it goes, is it? Happy april fools' day to you too, Norman!
dr110402 -- I'm thirsty! There's a water fountain up ahead! - SLURP SLURP - They don't build them as high as they used to! That one is for dogs, Watson!
dr110403 -- text text text text! text text text send! text text text! text text text! I miss the good old days when baseball players SPIT and SCRATCHED between pitches!
dr110404 -- zzyzx! - - ! - skattle skattle skattle - skattle skattle - CRUNCH CRUNCH skattle skattle How is it even possible to hear a potato chip fall on the carpet?
dr110405 -- Dad, how come you never use this really cool cell phone we bought you? - It does so many fun things! - I can't figure out how to turn it on. - Youth is wasted on the young, but really cool cell phones are wasted on the old!
dr110406 -- - Sweatpants with suspenders?? - The kids took my drawstring! Can you hear me now?
dr110407 -- I still believe that somewhere out there is the girl who's perfect for me! - But there are seven billion people! What are the odds that I will ever meet her? - If I ever meet her, I sure hope I make a good first impression! - BUMP! Oh, excuse
dr110407 -- me! HEY, WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING!
dr110408 -- I believe that somewhere out there is a girl who's a perfect match for me! - But where would I ever find someone that I have things in common with?? - BUMP! - You again??! Pardon me. I was daydreaming about my pet duck!
dr110409 -- It would be so nice to meet a girl who had lots of things in common with me... - WHOA!! - I'm sorry! I tripped! - I can't seem to keep my shoelaces tied! You know, you're starting to get on my nerves!
dr110410 -- No, you would NOT look good with tattoos, and quit using up all of our sticky notes!
dr110411 -- It's not every day that we go to a fancy banquet, honeybunch! Yes, I'm excited! - How do you like my tie and jacket? Nice! - Although I'm not sure they go with your sweatpants! Who cares? I'll be sitting down!

dr110414 -- Look, Ralph! We got a wedding invitation from our second-cousin's step niece! - They've enclosed an R.S.V.P. card... - We can check "accept with pleasure" or "decline with regret". - Are those our only choices? What if I want to DECLINE with
dr110414 -- pleasure??
dr110415 -- Bank - Why did you come to THIS window? You're supposed to wait for the next available teller! Oh. - I thought it meant YOU were the next available teller.
dr110416 -- ...Sigh... - - I hate windy days.
dr110417 -- Golf Lessons THWAK! - DANG! I sliced it AGAIN! Don't worry, Mr. Drabble! - I just recorder your swing! - I'll watch it in slow motion, and see if my trained eye can detect any subtle flaws in your swing! - - - BA HA HA HA HA! - HEY, GUYS!
dr110417 -- TAKE A LOOK AT THIS!! I think he detected something!
dr110418 -- It's been boring around here since basketball season ended! - I miss putting on our "blue dude" suits and leading the cheers! - We could cheer for other sports besides basketball, you know! Like what?? - I didn't even know we HAD a chess

dr110420 -- Hey! It's the unknown blue dude! And the blue dudette! - Now that basketball season is over, we didn't know if we'd see you again! We're glad you came! - Maybe one of you can explain lacrosse to us! What's Going On? Which Team Are We? I don't
dr110420 -- get it! What are the rules?
dr110421 -- Hey, batter batter! SWING! Go Girls! - CRACK! Uh-oh... - BONK! - Whoever named it "SOFTball" got it very wrong!
dr110422 -- I take exception to your point of view! - YAY!!! YA-HOO! clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap! - Go Debate Him! GOOD POINT! Way to Counter his Ad Hominem attack! WELL SAID! I really miss basketball season!
dr110423 -- Honeybunch, I want you to know that I haven't forgotten that you asked me to take out the trash. - I just forgot it for a little while! - But I won't forget again because I remember! - ...Sigh...
dr110424 -- I TOLD you easter came a lot later this year! When you're all done finding your eggs, will you kids help me trim the tree?
dr110425 -- By the way, Norman... - Thank you for being you! - It's a lousy job, but SOMEBODY'S gotta do it! Some days are certainly better than others!

dr110428 -- purrrrr
dr110429 -- KNOCK KNOCK ...Sigh... - Hello, sir! would you like to buy a coupon book? - Uh...no. OK. Have a nice day! - ?
dr110430 -- Sometimes I think I'm just too old to figure out the computer. - BLINK! Uh-ho...a warning just popped up. - It says, "you are now operating on reserve power." - You're telling ME!
dr110501 -- THWAK! - SPLASH! - THWAK! - CRACK! - THWAK! - bonk! OWW! ** - THWAK! - - The best tee shots are the ones where you don't hear a noise at the other end!
dr110502 -- I should be on "Dancing With The Stars". - I firmly believe that inside of me is a great dancer! - Good thing there's a lot of room in there! I guess that explains all the noise his stomach makes!
dr110503 -- Ralph, I need to warn you... - The doctor said this medication could cause me to become mildly irritable. - That's OK, honeybunch! smack! - Thanks for being so supportive! Mildly irritable would be an improvement.
dr110504 -- May I take your order, please? - Let's see...I'd like a... - GAAAAHHH!! - Sorry. We now have to post the calories on the menu board! ARE YOU TRYING TO GIVE ME A HEART ATTACK?!
dr110505 -- I'm sorry for the shock, Sir... - By law, we now have to post the calories of each of our menu items! - Hey, I believe in a healthy lifestyle as much as the next guy... - Well, maybe I don't.
dr110506 -- Sir, I know it's uncomfortable to see the calories posted on the menu... - But remember, you can alter your order! You can hold the cheese or the bacon or the sauce or the fries... - Good idea! OK, hold the lettuce! - That only saves you 2
dr110506 -- calories! ...and don't wrap the burger in paper because sometimes I accidentally eat some of it!
dr110507 -- Why did you have to start posting the calories on the menu board?? - If I jog home and play tennis for 3 hours, I can almost justify having the #5 combo! - Or you could just do without the fries and milkshake. AH HA! - You're funny!
dr110508 -- THWAK! - DANG! I'm short of the green AGAIN!! - Something must be wrong with my swing! - It might not be your swing, dad. I suspect you could have a problem with your vision! - What makes you suspect that? - Did you look in the mirror when
dr110508 -- you got dressed?
dr110509 -- Congratulate me, honeybunch! I finally achieved my goal! - My waist size is now a smaller number than my age! - Congratulations, Ralph! - And happy birthday! Thanks!
dr110510 -- You pathetic cat! - You stare out the window, waiting for honeybunch to come home because she's the one who feeds you! - Come to think of it, it IS getting pretty close to dinnertime! -
dr110511 -- Are you going to play golf today, dad? Yup! - It's a "best-ball" tournament! - You could be in trouble! These are some of the oldest golf balls I've ever seen!
dr110512 -- I am not overweight. I'm in perfect shape... - I am not overweight. I'm in perfect shape! - Who need exercise? It's all an issue of mind over matter! - Looks more like an issue of STOMACH over BELT!
dr110513 -- text text text - * - text text text text - When I was a kid, we just used our fingers to give the signs!
dr110514 -- I'm going to take Wally to the park! - Come on, Wally! Let's go get into the car! CAR?? Don't DRIVE the dog to the park! - The interior will get covered with hair! - Wally doesn't shed that much! I was talking about you!
dr110515 -- - - - Why does this stupid cat always sit on my stomach whenever I lie down on the couch??! - Cats like to sit way up high! Your stomach is obviously very soft. It's very big, too! Maybe she likes all the sounds it makes! - Why can't I ask a
dr110515 -- rhetorical question without everyone trying to answer it? - Because we like to be helpful! Who knows? What else do we have to do right now? It's probably just coincidental! SIGH...
dr110516 -- Leonard, Stu, Elgin...remember when we wore our blue-dude suits to the basketball game and some lady took our picture? Yeah. - She sent an email! She's a photographer for SPORTS ILLUMINATED magazine! - And guess what!!! - They're making
dr110516 -- another 'Star Trek' movie? Weird Al has a new CD?? McRibs are back?? Never ask a nerd to guess what.
dr110517 -- The blue dudes are going to be on the cover of SPORTS ILLUMINATED magazine? WHAT? We are??!! - Why?? The cover is a collage of crazy sports fans from across the country! - They sent us a mock.up! Look! - There we are, down in the corner!!
dr110517 -- WOW!
dr110518 -- When does the new SPORTS ILLUMINATED come out? Friday! I can't believe we made the cover! Millions of people will see us! - THIS IS THE MOST EXCITING DAY OF MY LIFE!! WE'RE GONNA BE FAMOUS!! - Except we were wearing our blue-dude suits! No
dr110518 -- one can see our faces! No one knows it's us! We can't tell anyone, and if we did, no one would believe us! - Other than that, it's kind of cool, I suppose. This is the worst day of my life!
dr110519 -- It doesn't matter that no one will know it's us on that magazine cover... - WE'LL know it's us in those blue suits, and we'll always know we're not losers anymore! - You have to be a WINNER to meet the coder of a sports magazine! We'll never
dr110519 -- be nerds again!! - Today it's the cover of SPORTS ILLUMINATED! Tomorrow, who knows?! Hopefully, the cover of LEGO SCULPTOR'S DIGEST!
dr110520 -- There it is! The new issue of SPORTS ILLUMINATED has hit the stands! - WE'RE FAMOUS! LET ME SEE! LET ME SEE!! - Where are we? In the lower-right corner! - Right behind the stupid BAR CODE! AAUGH!!
dr110521 -- So we didn't make the cover of Sports Illuminated after all! They covered us with the stupid bar code! - At least we avoided the CURSE! Those who make the cover often meet with misfortune! - SPLOOSH! - Actually, you can still see part of
dr110521 -- Norm's elbow!
dr110522 -- Ralph, are you going to spend the entire day lounging around? - For your information, I'm not "lounging around." I'm getting in shape! - The human body can burn 90 calories per hour while asleep! - I may LOOK like a lazy bum, but I'm actually
dr110522 -- hard at work! - My mistake. That's OK. Most people don't understand the science of weight loss! - No, I meant my mistake for marrying such a lout! I had a big lunch. I may be here for a while!
dr110523 -- You're eating a can of CAKE FROSTING??! - Shame on you, Ralph! - You're supposed to be on a diet! - You don't see me eating the CAKE, do you?!
dr110524 -- They say the supermarket is a great place to meet girls! - If I ever meet the perfect girl, I sure hope I say the right things! - 12 Items Or Less - YOU'VE GOT MORE THAN 12 ITEMS IN THERE!
dr110525 -- BEEEP! - Dad, the light is still red! Why did you honk at the car in front of us?? - Because when this light turns green, it doesn't last long! If he's not alert, we'll miss it! - You honk BEFORE it turns green??! BEEEP BEEEEP! It's called
dr110525 -- "preemptive honking"!
dr110526 -- Wally, calm down! tug tug tug! - I know you're excited to take a walk, but I can't find your harness! tug tug tug! - Oh well...it's hard to reason with an impatient wiener dog!
dr110527 -- squeak squeak squeak squeaky squeak! What? You want me to play ball with you? - No you don't. As soon as I reach for it, you're going to run away with it! - skattle skattle skattle! SEE?? I know how you think! - I've become an expert on
dr110527 -- wiener-doggery!
dr110528 -- Yawn... - Good morning, sunshine! - Nice of you to join us today! - She sure knows how to take the fun out of sleeping in!
dr110529 -- The key to a successful round of golf is to select the right ball. - No! Don't pick me! I don't want to end up at the bottom of a lake!! - Aw, don't be such a scaredy-act! - I think I'll use my 2-wood! No! Use the driver instead! - You're
dr110529 -- going to shank it, blame me, and then wrap me around a tree trunk! - Pipe down, you stupid club! I'm trying to concentrate! Please use the driver! I can't swim! - ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, YOU GUYS... This could be a bad omen! Dad doesn't usually
dr110529 -- start arguing with his equipment until the back nine!
dr110530 -- ...Sigh... - I'm like a car at an expired parking meter... - Just waiting to be towed away at the owner's expense... - ...to the junkyard of broken dreams. Men of a certain age should avoid mirrors!
dr110531 -- - - It's not every guy who gets greeted at the door by his pet duck! That's probably not something I'd brag about!
dr110601 -- Ah-ha! I've found your hiding place! - So THIS is where all you water bottles aggregate! - crunch crunch crunch Some dogs get into the garbage. Our dog gets into the recycle bin!
dr110602 -- Dang! That's not right, either! - I always do the crossword puzzle in pencil so I can erase my mistakes! scrub scrub scrub - erase erase erase scrub scrub - Game over.
dr110603 -- Looking at that ma in the mirror can be very depressing! - The view isn't exactly breathtaking from this side, either!
dr110604 -- - Ralph, the bites you take are always too big! - No they're not! - This is the size my mouth is!
dr110605 -- WHIRRRR! I'm almost done peeling the carrots, honeybunch! This is almost as bad as the time he sliced tomatoes with the ceiling fan!
dr110606 -- Who was Millard Fillmore's vice president? I forget. - Way to go! SLAP! What's going on? - I filled my brain to capacity last semester, so I have to try to forget as much as possible before next semester! - How big is Lake Huron? I forget.
dr110606 -- Sweet! I'm on a roll!
dr110607 -- ...Sigh... - Sometimes I think the odds are against me! - I've got news for you... - the EVENTS are against you, too!
dr110608 -- WHOOSH! - WHOOSH! - WHOOSH! - OK, the pool is inflated! I always knew you were mostly hot air!
dr110609 -- We took our deranged cat to the cat groomer. - Look at these BEFORE and AFTER pictures! They're hysterical! - The poor thing! - These are pictures of the GROOMER! - Yeah! Look at all the bandages in the AFTER picture!
dr110610 -- I never realized how big your nose is! - I mean, not that it's TOO big! It fits your head perfectly! - I mean, not that you have a big head! I goes just right with the rest of your body! - I mean, not that... Go outside and play, Norm!
dr110611 -- I'd like my burger medium-rare. - Rare in the middle, but slightly well-done around the edges! - Here. - Close enough. Wait a minute...that might be a hot dog!
dr110612 -- For all the years we've lived in this house, I always wished we had a laundry chute! - I hate lugging this heavy hamper downstairs on wash day! - But then I finally realized...I don't have to lug it all the way downstairs! - I can just dump
dr110612 -- all the clothes over the bannister! - I wish I had thought of that years ago! - I'm glad she didn't!
dr110613 -- Dad, I got a summer job! That's my boy!! - How much does it pay, son? - Actually, nothing. - But I only have to work for 2 minutes each night! Correction: he's YOUR boy!
dr110614 -- Dad, I'm in show business! I'm going to be in the "Pageant of the Painters". What's that? - It's a show where great works of art are recreated on stage using actors! - I'm going to play George Washington crossing the Delaware! - All I have to
dr110614 -- do is stand perfectly still like this for two minutes! You've always had a talent for standing around doing nothing!
dr110615 -- Dad, I need to rehearse for my part in the "Pageant of the Painters". - I'll be playing George Washington crossing the Delaware! - I have to hold this pose for two minutes! Time me! Go! - OK, that's enough! I'm tired. How long was that? Four
dr110615 -- seconds.
dr110616 -- Son, normally I'd think a job where all you have to do is stand still and do nothing would be right up your alley. - But I'm a little worried about it! - Relax, dad! What could possibly go wring? Well... - Hold that thought! I suddenly have
dr110616 -- to go to the bathroom!
dr110617 -- This show is great! I can't believe how they depict famous works of art using live models! - The costumes and makeup are amazing! How do they stand still for so long? - I can't wait to see Norman on stage! I'm just afraid he's going to mess
dr110617 -- it all up somehow! - You need to show more confidence in your son! OK, I'm CONFIDENT he's going to mess it all up somehow!
dr110618 -- "Washington crosses the Delaware" will be the next painting after the intermission! - I can't believe Norman is actually going to be onstage! - He'll do great! Nothing can go wrong! I have complete confidence in him! Me too! - But I'd better
dr110618 -- go backstage and remind him anyway! Good idea!
dr110619 -- World's Greatest Dad. One Of The Best Dads We Happen To Be Aware Of. At least *I* raised my kids not to exaggerate!
dr110620 -- Dad! What are you doing backstage?? - I go on in just a few minutes! I came to give you a pep talk, son! Don't be nervous? - I'm not nervous! HOW CAN YOU NOT Be NERVOUS?? - YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO ONSTAGE IN FRONT OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE
dr110620 -- JUST WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO GO WRONG!! This is a pep talk??
dr110621 -- Dad, I'm performing a living depiction of "Washington Crossing the Delaware"... - Don't worry about me! All I have to do is stand perfectly still for two minutes! - Why wouldn't I be able to stand still for that long?? - After I finish my
dr110621 -- big-swig, I'll be ready to go!
dr110622 -- Dad, there's no need to worry about me! I'll only be on stage for 2 minutes! - All I have to do is stand perfectly still! What could possibly go wrong? - ACHOO! - Darned allergies!
dr110623 -- And now we present..."Washington Crossing the Delaware". The curtain is rising! - There's Norman! - I sure hop he can stand still for the whole two minutes! - WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T THINK ABOUT YOUR NOSE ITCHING!
dr110624 -- I can't believe that's our son on-stage! - * - Hello? - Now I believe it!
dr110625 -- So much for my acting career! - All I had to do was stand still for 2 minutes, and I blew it! - What would posses you to answer your cell phone onstage? - Well, I don't get many calls! Leave it to you to get fired from a VOLUNTEER job!
dr110626 -- beep beep boop! - Oops! I just dialed a wrong number! - I hate it when I do that! - Now the person I dialed is going to call me back and ask why I called! I'll be so embarrassed! - * See? - Hello? ...oh, yes, I can explain... - My husband
dr110626 -- just borrowed my phone, and he must have dialed the wrong number. He's hopeless! Bye! - Sorry about that! - I knew I'd come in handy someday!

dr110702 -- Hello, Ralph. What can I do for you? - You know why I'm here, Steinbauer. - My barking dog? My midnight drum solos? The tools I haven't returned? - WHY DID YOU "UNFRIEND" ME??! Oh, that!
dr110703 -- Who are you calling? Our pets. - You're calling our PETS??? - We're going to be gone all day! Pets get lonely, you know! - I'll leave a message on the answering machine. They'll be reassured to hear the sound of my voice. - Why in the

dr110814 -- Hey, Norm, here's an easy job for you... - Go out to the car and put this vehicle registration sticker on the license plate! OK. - The REAR license plate. - Just peel off the sticker and put it in the upper-right corner of the rear plate!
dr110814 -- It's very simple! OK. - The upper right corner of the rear plate on OUR CAR!! - OK. And be careful because it's very sticky, and if you put it in the wrong place, it's almost impossible to... - On second thought, I'D better do it! OK. Thanks

dr110819 -- Dang! - I can't seem to tighten this screw! - Turn clockwise! - I still can't do it!
dr110820 -- Ahh! It's nice to sit in our yard and watch the worlds go by! - The grass is nice and green, isn't it? - That's because I've been watering it a lot! - Maybe a little TOO much! ?
dr110821 -- Hang on, Cheryl...I think I misplaced something! - I had it just a minute ago! - OK, this is driving me crazy! - Where can it be?? - Ralph, have you seen my cell phone? Yes. - Where is it? In you right hand! - - I think I've officially lost
dr110821 -- my mind! You'll need a search party to find that!
dr110822 -- It's sad being at an amusement park all by yourself. I wish I had a girlfriend. - The only advantage is that I can use the 'Singlerider' lines, which are much shorter. - The problem is, you never know who you'll have to sit next to! - It's
dr110822 -- HIM again! It's HER again!
dr110823 -- Hey, I recognize you... - Every time I wish I could meet the perfect girl for me, I bump into YOU! And you're always rude to me! - I am not! You are, too! - You're a rude dude! I hope this is a short ride!

dr110826 -- It's so weird...whenever I wish I could meet the perfect girl, I always bump into YOU! And you're always rude! - Now you tell me that your name is NORMA, which means "the perfect girl". - That might explain why YOU keep bumping into ME, but
dr110826 -- why do *I* keep bumping into YOU?? - It's not like I've been wishing to meet a rude lunkhead!
dr110827 -- Your name might mean, 'the perfect girl', but you're not very perfect! NEITHER ARE YOU! - Thank goodness this ride is almost over! I can't wait for it to end! - At last! The final plunge! IT'S ABOUT TIME! - Attention passengers: The ride has
dr110827 -- temporarily stopped. Please remain seated! NOOOO!
dr110828 -- Which direction is the wind blowing? In your case, it really doesn't matter. - I need to work on my slice! Your slice is fine. You need to work on hitting it straight! - It's about 200 yards. Do you think I should lay-up or go for it? I think
dr110828 -- you should aim for the cart path and pray for a good bounce! - What would you recommend, a five-iron or a hybrid? I'd recommend lessons. - Here, let me carry the clubs for a while! - SHOVE! SPLOOSH! - A knowledgeable caddy is hard to find,
dr110828 -- especially after you throw him in the lake.
dr110829 -- Please remain seated. The ride has stopped temporarily! - Great. - What could be worse than being stuck on a ride 50 feet off the ground? - Being stuck on a ride 50 feet off the ground with YOU! - IT WAS A RHETORICAL QUESTION!
dr110830 -- As long as we're stranded up here, you might as well tell me your name! Norman. - Really?? What a coincidence! My name's Norma! You told me, Norma means "The Perfect Girl." - Hey, does that mean NORMAN means "The Perfect Guy"? Let's see! -
dr110830 -- Nope. It means "Nerd from the North." Dang!
dr110831 -- Tell me something about yourself, Norman! - I'm afraid of wax museums. I AM TOO! - I've never met anyone else who was afraid of wax museums! - I thought I was the only one! Maybe we should get together sometime and not go to one!
dr110901 -- So, tell me something interesting about yourself! - I'm ambidextrous. I can write with either hand. - ME TOO! - Although I write way better with my right hand than with my left! I DO TOO!

dr110906 -- Just when I think the world is going to heck... - Something happens to restore my faith in the goodness of people! What happened? - Every person that I came in contact with today offered me a breath mint! - PEOPLE ARE SO GENEROUS!! Care for

dr111011 -- - - - A watched potato chip never drops!
dr111012 -- I'll never forget the time 16 years ago when you left a pack of gum in your shirt pocket! - It went through the wash and ruined everything! - Even now, when all is said and done, I'm still upset about it! - It may be all done, but it's never
dr111012 -- all said!
dr111013 -- Ralph, I've solved our Halloween candy problem... - I bought candy that you don't like! Now you won't be tempted to eat it before the trick-or-treaters get here! - Candy corn?? Yuck! Thank goodness there's something you don't like! - It's
dr111013 -- amazing how quickly one can acquire a taste for things!
dr111014 -- Candy for the rick-or-treaters! - Ralph, it's bad enough that you always eat the candy before Halloween... - Now you're eating it all before we even get to the checkstand! I'll go get another bag or two!
dr111015 -- You put the "Norm" in ABNORMAL! You put the "Path" in PATHETIC! - You put the "Eek" in GEEK! You put the "ick" in HICK! - Last summer, I met a girl named Norma, and I just realized that she's much nicer to me than you are! - So, bye! - Come

dr111016 -- rake rake rake - rake rake rake rake - - - - KER-SPLOOSH! - Dad always makes quite a splash! Ow. Even without water!
dr111017 -- Hello, Norman. I'm going to the library, in case you want to follow me around. - Perhaps you've forgotten what I told you last week, Wendy... - I met a girl named Norma who is much nicer to me than you are, so I'd prefer to spend my time with
dr111017 -- her. - Unfortunately, I forgot to get Norma's phone number, and I haven't seen her since!
dr111018 -- Dad, I need a little fatherly advice. Hold on, Norm! Let me put on my fatherly advice outfit... - OK, shoot! Last summer, I met the perfect girl. Her name is Norma, but now I don't know what to do! - Call her! That's the problem! I forgot to
dr111018 -- get her phone number! - WHAT A LUNKHEAD! Give me a break! I'm new at this "having a girl actually like me" stuff!
dr111019 -- Everywhere I'd go, I'd accidentally bump into the same girl. - I finally met her and realized she was the perfect girl, but I forgot to get her phone number! - I haven't bumped into her since, and I have no idea how to find her again! - Why
dr111019 -- can I never accidentally bump into someone on purpose??!
dr111020 -- Norma used to bump into me everywhere I went! - I'd be minding my own business, and all of a sudden, WHAM! I'd look up and there she'd be! - WHAM! - Sorry, dude! You're not even close!
dr111021 -- Why can't I bump into Norma again?? Where could she be?? - Let's see...what do I know about her? She's nice...she has a pet duck... - THAT'S IT!! MAYBE I'LL FIND HER AT THE DUCK SUPPLY SUPERSTORE!! - EXCUSE ME! bump! I'M IN A BIG HURRY!!
dr111022 -- Norma!! I haven't seen you since last summer! I was afraid we'd never bump into each other again! - I can't believe I never even got your phone number! How stupid could I have possibly been?? - OK, bye! - Dang!
dr111023 -- It's weird, Norma...we met each other only a few weeks ago, but I feel like I've known you for a long time! - BUMP - I have a feeling we may have bumped into each other a time or two over the years!
dr111024 -- ...Sigh... - Why so glum? - I think I'm going through a mid-life crisis! - Better late than never!
dr111025 -- Hey, what are you doing?! We're going to carve a pumpkin! - It's too early! Halloween is still a week away! - You've go to be PATIENT! Go ask your mom! - Ask me what? Never mind.

dr111109 -- Honeybunch, you... - ...have an annoying habit of finishing other people's sentences? - Oh, I do not! - Me... ow? Yes, your dinner is coming!
dr111110 -- Look at this, Patrick! Today's date is 11-10-11! - Isn't that amazing? - Tomorrow it will be 11-11-11! - WHY DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO TOP ME?!
dr111111 -- - - - I'm a lap dog in search of a lap!
dr111112 -- ...Sigh... - So we're sitting here watching TV instead of cleaning the garage BECAUSE...? - Because I forgot that you asked me to do that! - She not only finishes my sentences, she STARTS some of them, too!
dr111113 -- I have to referee Patrick's soccer game today. - It always wears me out! - Unfortunately, every parent has to ref at least once during the season. - Oh, for Pete's sake. - - Will you kids try to keep the ball on one side of the field or the
dr111113 -- other?!! He's the laziest ref I've ever seen!

dr111124 -- Facebook has the right idea... - You can always "unfriend" people! - Too bad you can't "unrelative" people! Family get-togethers can be stressful! - DON'T LET THE DOOR HIT YOU ON THE WAY OUT, RALPH! THANKS FOR THE TURKEY, TURKEY!
dr111125 -- Make a wish, Norm! OK, let's see... - Should I make a wish for myself, or for something to benefit mankind? - If I make a wish for myself, I might feel guilty. But the needs of mankind are so complex, I'd be afraid of wishing for the wrong. -
dr111125 -- WILL YOU HURRY UP!! Sorry, but I'm feeling a lot of pressure!
dr111126 -- Sometimes dad reminds me of a superhero. - Which one? Batman? Superman? Spider-Man? - Iron Man!

dr111129 -- The best place in town to eat is the snack bar at the bulk club! - A hot dog and soda combo only costs $1.50! - I can feed my family of five for only $7.50! - Or just me for about $10!
dr111130 -- Dad, how can I tell if I've met the right girl? Invite her to dinner at the bulk club snack bar. - But all they have are hot dogs, pizza and churros! It's not fancy at all! Exactly! - If she's OK with that, then you've got the right girl! OK!
dr111130 -- - If she wants to go someplace fancier, like the snack bar at the car wash, look out!
dr111201 -- Invite her to dinner at the Bulk Club Snack Bar! If she's OK with that, you've got the right girl! - Norma, how would you like to have dinner with me at the Bulk Club Snack Bar? - Did you just invite me to the Bluk Club Snack Bar??? Yeah. -
dr111201 -- THAT'S MY FAVORITE PLACE!! I'm beginning to think some things are just meant to be!
dr111202 -- Norma, I can't believe you like the bulk club snack bar as much as I do! - Why eat anything else? It's amazing! Norma really IS the perfect girl for me! - But nobody's perfect! There's GOT to be SOMETHING wrong with her! What could it be?? -
dr111203 -- Dad, this new girl, Norma, seems perfect. She likes all the things *I* like! So, what's the problem? - There must be SOMETHING wrong with her! Nobody's perfect! What's the catch? - Norman, you're overthinking things! - Now THERE'S something I
dr111203 -- never thought I'd say! I know. That was very nice of you!
dr111204 -- Dad, can I borrow the car keys? - I suppose. Thanks. - HONK HONK HONK What's that?? - You must have accidentally pressed the panic button! Now our car is honking in the driveway! - HONK HONK HONK What should I do?? Press it again! - HONK HONK
dr111204 -- HONK No, not THAT button! The red one! - HONK HONK HONK HONK The WHICH one?? RING RING Oh, great! Now the neighbors are calling to complain! - HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK BARK BARK BARK BARK BARK RING RING RING
dr111204 -- I give up! Yet another reason not to give Norman the car keys!
dr111205 -- Hello, Miss Utely? This is Penny Drabble's mother. - I want to speak to you about the grade you gave her on her snowflake sculpture. I think she deserved better than a 'C'. - I worked...I mean, she worked very hard on this! I spent...I mean,
dr111205 -- she spent hours on it, and I... - Oh, never mind!
dr111206 -- What's the problem, Norm? Norman seems like the perfect girl, but I know nobody's perfect. - She must have SOME kind of flaw, but I can't figure out WHAT! It constantly nags at me! - You have no idea what it's like to have something nag at
dr111206 -- you all the time! - Seriously??? Careful, mom at two o'clock!
dr111207 -- Norma seems perfect! Nobody's perfect! - She is! She must have a hidden flaw! - Maybe she gets mead easily! I suggest you try to make her really mad, just to see how long it takes before she... - You need to stop listening to this guy!!
dr111208 -- I'd like a small yogurt with vanilla on the bottom and chocolate on top! - And I'd like a small with chocolate on the bottom and vanilla on the top! - I KNEW it was too good to be true! I KNEW she couldn't possibly be my perfect match! That's
dr111208 -- it, we're through! - On second thought, put the chocolate on top! Whew! That was close!
dr111209 -- ...and that's what *I* think about it! - I echo your sentiments completely! I know. You always do! - Instead of NORMA, I should start calling you ECHO! Echo?? - I LIKE IT!!! Me too!
dr111210 -- Oops! I forgot something! - BUMP! - Why are you always in my way?! - It must be your magnetic personality.
dr111211 -- I've come to the conclusion that the best time of day is 4:50P.M.! - School is over, and my homework is done, and mom's cooking dinner! - My favorite time is 10:15 A.M.! Why? - Because that's when recess begins! - My favorite time of day is
dr111211 -- 11:17 P.M. because that's when the weather girl on channel 9 comes on! - When buying a sofa, a man should take into consideration that he may have to sleep on it now and then!
dr111212 -- Oops! - SNARF! - CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH - I'm sure it's just a "dog" thing, but food that's dropped always seems to taste better!
dr111213 -- Bleech!! These cookies are stale! - Here you go, Wally! They're all yours! - How insulting! - Tasty, but insulting!
dr111214 -- I have an idea: let's go to the wax museum! WHAT?? - I'm SCARED of wax museums!! I know! Me too! - But if we go together, we won't feel so embarrassed about being scared, and we might even conquer our fears! NOT A CHANCE! - Of course, I'd
dr111214 -- probably be clingy and hang all over you! Let's go! It closes in an hour!
dr111215 -- Tell me again why we've come here, echo! To help each other overcome our fears! - We're both terrified of wax museums, but as long as we're together, nothing can scare us! - GAAAHH!!! - Except maybe the price of admission! Is that decimal
dr111215 -- point in the right place?
dr111216 -- If you encounter a vampire, you can kill it with a wooden stake. - If you're attacked by a werewolf, you'll need a silver bullet. - But what can you use on a WAX FIGURE that comes to life?? Hey, THIS might work! - ...if we can find an
dr111216 -- electrical outlet!
dr111217 -- WE DID IT!! - We made it through the WAX MUSEUM!! - We confronted our fears together and we survived!! - So what if we ran through with our eyes closed! That was the longest nine seconds of my life!
dr111218 -- I can't believe how smoothly the decorating is going this year! - Usually when Norman and I work together to put up Christmas lights around the house, it takes forever! - We get in each other's way and waste a lot of time! - I have to fix all
dr111218 -- of Norman's goof-ups! - But not this year! So far, so good! - So when are you going to help me get down? In due time!
dr111219 -- DADDY! WAKE UP! Huh...? Wha...? - What's wrong, Penny? I can't fall asleep! - I'm just too nervous! Why? - It's the night before the night before the night before the night before the night before Christmas! This is going to be a long week!
dr111220 -- Dad, what would you like me to buy you for Christmas? A tie would be nice. - How much would you want me to spend on it? No more than $15. - Can I borrow this $15? Sure. - Ah, heck! Make it $25! I don't want you to think I'm a cheapskate!
dr111221 -- Dad, it says here right in the book... - "The STOCKINGS were hung by the chimney with care..." - Not SWEATPANTS! Whatever!
dr111222 -- Our tree isn't drinking! - SNARF! - - It seems to be eating all right!
dr111223 -- ? - nudge nudge nudge - YES! - I shouldn't have unwrapped my gift early, but I couldn't resist! skattle skattle
dr111224 -- Look, Penny! Look! - I see a red light in the sky and it's MOYING! - You know that's just a plane, don't you? - Oh, yeah, huh! Poor dad. He gets so excited on Christmas eve!

dr111226 -- house looks like a giant snow globe!
dr111227 -- We can put it in the tank like this... - And it will take up space. - So now we'll save water every time we flush! - Every holiday season, I find new ways to make use of a fruitcake!
dr111228 -- Time to take down our Christmas decorations. It's about time, honeybunch. - It seems like they've been up forever! - Oh, don't exaggerate! Who's exaggerating?? - The shopping mall complains that WE start decorating too early!
dr111229 -- Dad, how will I know when I've me the right girl? - You'll want to marry her and she'll want to marry you! - And I'll cry at the wedding because it seems like only yesterday I was tying your shoesies! - Remind me to elope! Come to think of
dr111229 -- it, it WAS yesterday!
dr111230 -- skattle skattle skattle Sigh... - Do you HAVE to follow me around wherever I go?? - No. - I'm just really, really nice! skattle skattle
dr111231 -- - I could've sworn you already took down the Christmas decorations! I did. - And today I'm putting them back up! - She's put up the decorations earlier every year! *Oh, it's beginning to look a lot like...*
dr120101 -- It's bad enough having to go see the doctor... - But it's even worse when you have to wait for him in the exam room! - It can take forever and there's nothing to do to pass the time! - ...Sigh... - Tongue depressors? - - Hello, Mr.
dr120101 -- Drab...what on earth?? flappa tappa tappa tappa tappa tappa tappa tappa tappa - YouTube, here we come!
dr120102 -- - - - - Next year, let's put the tree closer to the front door!
dr120103 -- I feel let down after the holidays. I need something to pick me up! - A FORKLIFT couldn't pick you up! - Oh, great! You just caused me to break my resolution to be less snarky! - Try to be more considerate and don't give me straight lines
dr120103 -- like that! How thoughtless of me!
dr120104 -- Sweet! I found a gingerbread cookie under the couch! - You can't eat that! It's been on the floor too long! - Only since December! - Most households have a three-second rule. We have a THREE-WEEK rule!
dr120105 -- Ralph, this is such a long, boring drive...let me drive for a while! No thanks! - But you must be tired and fatigued! I'd be happy to take over! That's OK. - Ralph, pull over and let me drive! Why are you being so stubborn?? ...Sigh... - When

dr120110 -- OK, fellow blue dudes, our team is losing! Let's work our magic! - Let's inspire them to victory! Let's hold up our signs and get the crowd amped! Like we did last year! - Hold You Heads High in Defeat! At Least Your Parents Still Love You! -
dr120110 -- You're Not Bad At Everything! Losing Builds Character! Maybe we're a little rusty!
dr120111 -- OK, Blue Dudes! We're here to support our team and cheer them to victory! Let's see if we're all here: Leonard! Here! Stu! Here! Elgin! Here! - The unknown blue dude! Here! The blue dudette! Here! The blue blue dude! I'm very sad. The rude

dr120115 -- Look what I bought at the Bulk Club, Ralph! - A jumbo container of gourmet jelly beans! - I LOVE these! They come in so many exotic flavors! - Passion fruit, buttered popcorn, kiwi, tangerine,,, - You can even combine them to get other
dr120115 -- flavors! Banana, chocolate, cherry and vanilla tastes like a banana split! - But I like to eat them one at a time so I can taste the individual flavors! - What's YOUR favorite way to eat jelly beans, Ralph? - Thay wha...? I'll give you a
dr120115 -- second.
dr120116 -- Our December bills are huge this year! - I wish we hadn't bought all that stuff! - Are you having buyer's remorse? No... - I'm having HUSBAND-of-buyers remorse!
dr120117 -- Ahem! Oh, sorry! - Pardon me. sorry! - Beep beep! Sorry! - Is it my imagination, or am I getting in everyone's way more often as I get older? Excuse me!
dr120118 -- Spaghetti again? - Boy, we sure seem to have spaghetti a lot! - Point well taken. - I have a hard time believing that point was well taken!
dr120119 -- ...Sigh... - You wouldn't want to go outside in the freezing rain and take a stupid walk, would you? - - You're weird. Dogs think everything is a good idea!
dr120120 -- You shouldn't sit up like that. It's bad for your back! - Here. - I only gave you that so you'd sit back down! crunch crunch! - Bad strategy.
dr120121 -- What do you want to do with your life, son? - Beats me. What kind of field would you like to work in? - I don't know. - What's your college major? - "Undecided". Sounds like you'll graduate with honors!
dr120122 -- WALLY! - COME ON, WALLY! WE NEED TO GO OUTSIDE FOR A WALK! - I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO GO OUT IN THE RAIN, BUT YOU HAVE TO! - WHERE ARE YOU HIDING? DON'T MAKE ME COME LOOKING FOR YOU! - * - Here kitty, kitty, kitty! - WHERE'S the kitty? WHERE?
dr120122 -- WHERE?? - And he wonders why I chew up the magazines!
dr120123 -- Norm, let me give you a little fatherly advice... - Life is short. Be bold! Take changes! If you want something, go for it! - You're right, dad! - So I'm going to propose to echo! WHAT?? You were right about that "life is short" part!
dr120124 -- That's right, dad! You've convinced me to pop the question to echo! ...Sigh... - I've come to the conclusion that she's the perfect girl for me! Thanks for the fatherly advice! - But son, you're so YOUNG! And you haven't even met her FAMILY!
dr120124 -- - But son, you're so YOUNG! And you haven't even met her FAMILY! - Minor details! From now on, let ME give the fatherly advice!
dr120105 -- Son, listen to me! Don't rush into things! - I know how it goes: you marry someone who's cute and nice, and then afterwards... - They even get cuter and nicer! - How did you know she was behind you? The temperature of the room dropped.
dr120126 -- Don't worry, dad! I've got it all planned down to the smallest detail... - Echo and I will have dinner at our favorite place, the Bulk Club Food Court. - After we finish our churro, I'll get down on one knee and and pop the question! She'll
dr120126 -- cry with joy! - I never knew you were so romantic! I even bought a pen with a heart on top for her to sign the pre-nup agreement!
dr120127 -- Echo, we have so much in common! We get along so well together... - I have an important question to ask you... - Will you please be mine? Nope. - Echo, you've made me the happiest...wait, what?! The pizza is really good tonight!
dr120128 -- NO?? But we have so much in common! I thought you LIKED me! I do like you, Norman! - Unfortunately, my heart belongs to another! - He's dynamic! He's fun! He's exciting! - I KNEW there had to be something wrong here! Did I mention he's fun
dr120128 -- and exciting?
dr120129 -- Every father should practice his glare! - If you have a good glare, your kids are more apt to be good, because they don't want you to give them that look! - Sometimes I give my kids the glare BEFORE they can get into trouble, just as a
dr120129 -- precaution! - In fact, something tells me this would be a good time to give Norman the glare, but he already left on a date! - I have an idea! Parenthesis...colon...u...parenthesis! text text text send! - * chirp chirp! - My dad sent me a
dr120129 -- text! - Read this sideways! ):U( Yikes! It's the glare!
dr120130 -- I knew it was too good to be true! I popped the question and she burst my bubble! - Echo's in love with another guy! She couldn't stop telling me about all of his great qualities! - He's dynamic, he's fun, he's exciting... chip chirp! - Oh,
dr120130 -- good. He's also a leader! So nice of her to send a text!
dr120131 -- Rejected by the girl of my dreams! I'm so depressed! - You need to get your mind off it, Norm! Fortunately, there's a basketball game tonight. - Let's put on our blue suits and go have fun! You'll feel better in no time! - SCORE! WIN! GO! I
dr120131 -- hope! WHATEVER
dr120201 -- What's wrong with the head blue dude? He's kind of sad, blue dudette! - Sad?? But he's our LEADER! If HE acts sad, we're ALL going to act sad! - We might not be able to inspire to victory tonight! - IT'S ONLY A GAME. BIG DEAL. WHO CARES. BLAH
dr120201 -- BLAH BLAH. See what I mean?
dr120202 -- It's useless! Since Echo dumped me for another guy, I'm to depressed to lead the Blue Dudes anymore! - She says he's fun and exciting and dynamic...all the thing's I'm not! - No more Blue Dudes for me. I'm going home! - NORMAN?? I recognize
dr120202 -- that voice!
dr120203 -- Norman! YOU'RE the leader of the Blue Dudes?? - Your voice is strangely familiar! I can't believe it! - I joined the Blue Dudes because I had a crush on the leader and the leader is YOU?? - WENDY??!! I think I'm going to be sick!
dr120204 -- Wendy was the Blue Dudette?? Darn! I was hoping it was... - ECHO!! Norman! I didn't know you were the head Blue Dude!! - The leader of the Blue Dudes is the guy I thought was so fun and exciting!! - Who in a million trillion bazillion years
dr120204 -- would've thought it could be YOU?? Who indeed!
dr120205 -- Welcome To Super Bowl XLVI What does XLVI men, dad? - 46! This Super Bowl Number 46, Penny! - XLVI is 46 in roman numerals! The X stands for ten, the I stands for one, and the L and the V stand for the rest of it! - Actually, the I might
dr120205 -- stand for "Investigation," like in "CSI: Miami". Whatever! - Gee, dad, you're 46, too! Maybe you should call yourself Ralph Drabble *XLVI*! - In HIS case, it would stand for extra-large village idiot! I wonder if the LV stands for Las Vegas?
dr120206 -- Oh, no... - He'd better not say it... - I just know he's going to say it... - So, you thought I was pretty cute in my blue dude outfit, eh? TAXI!
dr120207 -- pick pick claw claw1 - HEY, YOU DUMB CAT! DON'T DO THAT! SCRAM! - I thought you wanted Oogie to use the scratching post! I do! - But it's better to act like I don't! pick pick claw!
dr120208 -- bark bark bark roff roff roff You dumb dog! - roff roff bark bark bark It's just me! Why are you barking? - It could've been a stranger who looked like you, smelled like you and sounded like you! - ...Sigh... At the Wiener Dog Academy, they
dr120208 -- teach us to bark first and ask questions later!
dr120209 -- - - - "Close" only counts in horseshoes and the wastebasket in our kids' bathroom!
dr120210 -- This lane is much too bumpy! Move over into the other lane, please. OK. - This lane is even bumpier! - They should resurface this highway! - Or maybe you should just put on your makeup BEFORE you leave! Darn!
dr120211 -- Dad, I know you love your sweatpants, but I think you need to buy some new ones! - Those have so many holes in them, I don't think they're technically considered sweatpants anymore! I think they have a few more years in them!
dr120212 -- Look at all those ducks down by the lake, Wally! - GO GET 'EM! - ROFF ROFF ROFF ROFF - - I can't believe he let Wally frighten those ducks! - RALPH!! - DON'T SCARE ME LIKE THAT!!
dr120213 -- Hey! I thought this was the OLDIES station! - It IS the oldies station! - This song isn't an oldie! It was my favorite song in high school! - Maybe you should get out your quill and write a letter to the station! I'm out of parchment.
dr120214 -- Norman, you know I love the food court at the bulk club... - But I'm surprised you'd get the idea to bring me here for our valentine's date! - I'll take that as a compliment, Echo! Great minds think alike, eh, son? So do cheap minds!
dr120215 -- This is my favorite night of the week! I haul the trash cans out to the curb... - And when I wake up in the morning, the cans will be empty again! - It's kind of magical! - Trash day eve is very exciting!
dr120216 -- Gather 'round, kids! It's FATHERLY ADVICE night! - Dad, when you give us fatherly advice, try to be brief and to the point! - And try not to repeat yourself! Yeah, and avoid long stories! The father is the advisER, not he advisEE!
dr120217 -- Kids, the loose french fries at the bottom of the bag always taste the best! - You've told us that before, dad! I have? OK, let's see... - Never buy a green suit! You've told us that before, too! - Dang! I'm running out of fatherly advice!

dr120221 -- Hurry up the stairs! We're gonna be late! - Did you know that every time a person climbs stairs, they begin with the same foot? - Which foot do YOU start with? - Are you coming? Quiet! I'm trying to think!
dr120222 -- Well, I'd better let you go! By the way, how do you like your new job? - ...that's good. Well, I'll say goodbye now. How's your mother? - ...OK, well, I really need to go now! What's new with your sister? - Boy, it's hard to get some people

dr120123 -- This movie is driving me crazy! - I have no idea what's going on! - Don't feel bad, dear... - You had no idea what was going on BEFORE you got to the movie, either! Oh, yeah, huh!
dr120224 -- Honeybunch, do you mind if I have a soda? Of course I don't mind! - Why would I mind? You're a grown man! Do what you want! - Stop seeking my permission for everything! It drives me crazy! - Allow me to apologize. THERE YOU GO AGAIN!

dr120226 -- Ralph, don't cram so many french fries in your mouth all at once! - It's disgusting! Eat them one at a time! - Honeybunch, it's impossible for a man to eat only one french fry at a time. No man can do it! - Just watch that guy sitting behind
dr120226 -- you! - - Good heavens! What is it about men that...HEY! DID YOU STEAL SOME OF MY FRIES!? - If you don't believe me, just look at the guy behind you! Men are all in cahoots, aren't they?!!

dr120301 -- Congratulations on passing the security check, kids! - - whoosh whoosh - Here! Have a blue latex glove! In the good old days, they'd give the kids pilot wings!
dr120302 -- Do I HAVE to go through the security x-ray? - I think it' sundignified! No problem! We can check you the old-fashioned way! - On the return trip, I'll just do the x-ray!
dr120303 -- I'm home! Did you bring me anything, daddy? - My friend Sophia's dad works in a bakery and brings her things from work! - Keep in mind I work as an airport security screener! - How about some confiscated toenail clippers?
dr120304 -- He did it again! I can't believe it! - Ralph, when you put away a box of crackers, you need to close the bag inside properly! - Don't just wad up the bag and close the flap! Fold the bag down over and over! Like this! - The go to the drawer

dr120310 -- Ralph, can I say something without you getting all defensive? - Why do you always assume I'm going to be defensive? - That's not very nice of you! - I'll take that as a 'no'.
dr120311 -- Oh, man! My feet are killing me! - You mom bought me a new pair of shoes last week, and they feel to small! - You've been walking around for a week in shoes that are too small?! Why don't you take them back?? - According to the label, they're

dr120322 -- This is the most boring book I've ever read! - My eyes are tired from moving back and forth so much! - Maybe I should just listen to this book on tape! - They don't record pop-up books on tape, Penny! Fine. I'll just wait for the movie!
dr120323 -- I can't believe you're still reading that book, Penny! I'm not. I'm UN-reading it! - UNreading it?? I read it all and I hated it! - The only way to get it out of my mind is to unread it by reading it backwards! - How come *I* never thought of

dr120327 -- Dad, why do we have to go outside and fly a kite? - It's unhealthy to stay indoors all day playing video games! - I want you kids to start living a more healthy lifestyle! - If you're good sports, I'll take you to get donuts!
dr120328 -- Kids today spend too much time immersed in technology. - They don't know how to play outside anymore. That's why I'm teaching you to fly a kite! - One day you'll thank me! - Although it will probably be tweeted! - Isn't there an app for
dr120328 -- playing outside?
dr120329 -- Our kite is flying! We did it!! - Is this fun, or what?! - - Anybody else want to stand here and hold it? I don't think I could handle the excitement.
dr120330 -- Society tells kids to spend all their free time immersed in technology. - But as your father, I feel a responsibility to teach you about the finer things in life! - The world may be against me, but I refuse to give up! - Did I mention the
dr120330 -- world is against me?

dr120410 -- "Husband". That makes it easy1 - Happy anniversary, honeybunch! - Ralph, you bought me a card that says "To the Man I Married"! I did? - You need to READ the cards before you buy them! When the sign on the rack says "husband", I thought it
dr120410 -- meant husbands should buy these!
dr120411 -- The world is yours, son. - you can do anything you can put your mind to! There is nothing to fear but fear itself! - Never give up! Winners never quit! - My philosophy is to keep talking on my kids and hope something sinks in eventually.
dr120412 -- Oh, hi! - Just a second. - Here you go! Grrr! - Looks like our mobile cat groomer has had a rough week!
dr120413 -- When I was a kid, they told us things would be better in the 21st century. - They lied. - What's dad so upset about? - He set the DVR to record "American Idol", and it stopped before he saw who got voted off! They also lied about all of us

dr120417 -- I don't understand it. - It kind of bugs me. - Dogs are man's best friend! - So how come your place is cooler than mine? Women do the shopping!
dr120418 -- Norman, those are YESTERDAY'S TV listings! - I know. I like to see what I missed! - Dang! I would've LIKED to have seen THIS show! - Some people are gluttons for punishment!
dr120419 -- Hey! It's What's-His-Name! - 9th Place - I won five dollars! I won five dollars!! - Some people have delusions of grandeur. I have delusions of mediocrity!
dr120420 -- I'm home! Hi, dad! - How's my little girl?! - Some day you'll be too big for me to pick up and toss in the chair. - I a few years, I'll be lucky if I can toss a salad! * * *
dr120421 -- meow meow meow! All right, I'll feed you... - Hey, you've got plenty of food, you dumb cat! - You can't have more just because it's been sitting around all day! - Eat that first! What am I? Some kind of animal?

dr120425 -- - - - It's a buffet! I can go back as many times as I want! That makes eleven!
dr120426 -- ...Sigh... - Our kids spend so much time texting and playing games... - How can we reduce their dependence on modern technology? - Maybe there's an app for that!
dr120427 -- I get the feeling that you and Mr. Steinbauer don't get along. - We don't. - But you know the old saying: "Good fences make for good neighbors." - Barbed wire helps, too!
dr120428 -- Congratulate me, honeybunch! - I have given up donuts again! - - Fine. See if I bother to tell her the NEXT time I give up donuts!
dr120429 -- - Go get 'em, Wally! - pop! snarf! pop! snarf! pop! snarf! pop! pop! snarf! pop! snarf - Good job, Wally! You got 'em all! - I'd like to see you try to improve on that! Watch. - SLASH! CLAW! SLICE! SLASH! - Yawn!
dr120430 -- YIPES!! - When did we get a high-definition MIRROR?? About the same time you got a high-definition FACE!
dr120501 -- - * - One of my better ideas! When your father gets an idea, it's a REFRIGERATOR light bulb that goes on in his head!
dr120502 -- The expiration date on this week was last week. - Oh, well...that's not the only old thing in my stomach! - So far today, I've had day-old bread, leftover pizza and expired milk. - I feel like a human time capsule!
dr120503 -- - - What's for dinner? Macaroni and cheese! - She finishes my sentences before I can even START them!
dr120504 -- Hardware Store - - Perfect! Most people don't put a welcome mat in front of the refrigerator! Most people don't visit it as often as he does!
dr120505 -- Fast-forward...fast-forward... - STOP!! - Dang! Fast-forward again! - I hate it when you speed through the commercials and they make it look like the show is about to start again, but instead it's another commercial!
dr120506 -- Hey, I found a dollar! - Wait a minute... - Whenever I find money on the ground, I worry that it's a prank! - It's probably glued to the ground and I'm being video-taped, and when I try to pick it up I'll make a fool of myself. - And before
dr120506 -- you know it, I'll be all over the Internet! - Hey, a dollar! - - Yup, that's me. I can't believe you fell for the old "don't-picj-it-up-because-it-might-be-glued-to-the-ground" trick!
dr120507 -- I'm excited to go to a major league baseball game, Norman! Me too, Echo! - Maybe they'll put us on the "kiss cam"! - There are so many people here! I hope you can find your car after the game! I worried about that, too... - So I left the
dr120507 -- headlights on! Why didn't *I* think of that?!
dr120508 -- Tonight's game is a sellout, Norman! - How did you get the tickets? I bought them from a scalper! - Right this way, ma'am! Your seat is down on the field-level! Nice! - And your seat is in the upper deck! WHAT?!!
dr120509 -- Can you see me, Echo? I'm in the last row! - Yeah! I can't believe our seats are in different sections! - I guess I should've looked more closely before I bought the tickets! - That scalper seemed like such a nice guy!
dr120510 -- How do you like your seat, Norman? - I hate it because it's not next to YOUR seat! - ...it's also in the top row of the upper deck, and my view is obstructed by the foul pole. - And I'm sitting between two drunken fans who are rooting for
dr120510 -- different teams! - With my luck, this game will go extra innings!
dr120511 -- I seem to be sitting in the PWDY section! - That's too bad! Everyone around me is very nice! - The view is great from here! It sure is! - TALL THAT GUY NEXT TO YOU TO KEEP HIS EYES ON THE GAME!
dr120512 -- I'm in the top deck and you're down below! I can't believe I paid for seats that aren't together! - I'm really sorry, Echo! I feel like I've ruined our date! - If it makes you feel better, I'm having a nice time anyway! - Why would that make
dr120512 -- me feel better?
dr120513 -- Happy mother's day, Honeybunch! - Thank you, Ralph! What a nice card! - Did you read it? - Of course I read it! How else would I know which card to buy you? - What did it say? - "USA $2.99, Canada $3.99"
dr120514 -- Norman, guess what! The guy next to me caught a foul ball and GAVE it to me! - That's what *I* wanted to do!! I wanted to catch a ball and give it to YOU and be a HERO! That's why I brought my GLOVE!! - Instead, I'm sitting between two
dr120514 -- drunks in the last row of the upper deck! - The only thing I'm going to catch up here is PNEUMONIA! He didn't bring a glove. He caught it bare-handed!
dr120515 -- I bought baseball tickets for Echo and me, but the seats weren't together! Pucker Up! It's the KISS CAM - She's downstairs next to a guy who's flirting with her, and I'm in the upper deck between two drunks! - It can't get much worse than
dr120515 -- this! - I stand corrected! KISS CAM *
dr120516 -- I can't believe it!! - Echo's on the 'Kiss Cam' with that guy who's been flirting with her!! KISS CAM - Is she going to kiss him?? What's going to happen??? - STOP DOING THE WAVE! I CAN'T SEE!!
dr120517 -- WHAT HAPPENED?! I COULDN'T SEE! DID SHE KISS HIM?? - !!* That girl on the kiss cam! Did she kiss him??! @*!!! - WILL YOU DRUNKS SHUT UP AND GET A LIFE!!! - Just kidding!
dr120518 -- Did you just call us DRUNKS? I don't recall. Hic! - ALL RIGHT, BREAK IT UP! Thank goodness! Security has arrived! LET'S GO, TROUBLEMAKER! ME?? I'm not the DRUNK! All I've had is a FROZEN MALT!
dr120519 -- Hello, Echo? I'm embarrassed to tell you they just threw me out of the stadium! - I told off those obnoxious drunks, and got ejected for causing a disturbance! - That's OK, Norman. I got thrown out, too! WHY??! - When that guy tried to kiss
dr120519 -- me on the 'Kiss Cam', I punched him in the nose!
dr120520 -- So, what do you do, young man? I'm a student. - snip snip snip! - snip snip! snip snip! - So, what do YOU do for a living? - I'm a barber. - Oh, yeah, huh! - snip snip! I've never been good at making small talk!
dr120521 -- I'd like a haircut, please! Have you been here before? - No. Please fill out a customer information card. - Name? Address? Phone number? E-Mail? Good grief! - I want a HAIRCUT, not a LOAN!
dr120522 -- Polecat Little League ...Sigh... - chirp chirp! - Look alive out there! - Well, you don't like it when I yell at him!
dr120523 -- There! I just adjusted the clock on your dashboard! Why?? - It was an hour off! You never changed it for daylight saving time a couple of months ago! - So what? I always knew what time it was because I knew it was one hour later than what the
dr120523 -- clock said! - Well, now the time is correct! But now I'll always be an hour EARLY for everything!!
dr120524 -- Norman, why did you change the clock in my car?? - It was an hour slow! You never reset it for daylight saving time two months ago! - Why bother to do that?? - It was going to be correct again in four months!
dr120525 -- I wish you hadn't changed the clock, Norm! - But it was an hour slow! The correct time is *3:00§, not *2:00*! - Yeah, except now it says it's three AM instead of three PM! - I don't know how to change the AM and PM! My clock used to be an
dr120525 -- hour off. Now it's TWELVE hours off!
dr120526 -- Summer is only three months long, dad... - What's taking so long? Mom said you had plenty of hot air! - You should've started around easter! I work faster without an audience.
dr120527 -- Honeybunch? - Honeybunch? - Where is she?? - I can never find her when I need her! - Maybe she's not even home! - There's one sure-fire way to find out... - rustle rustle - Stay out of those potato chips! Never fails!
dr120528 -- Interesting. This can of cake frosting is only 100 calories per serving. - There are 13 servings in this can. If I ate it for a midnight snack, it would be 1,300 calories! - This other can is *140* calories per serving. That's a big
dr120528 -- difference! - It's important to read the nutritional information if you're serious about losing weight!
dr120529 -- Snacking AGAIN?? You've been eating a lot today, Ralph! - I eat when I'm worried. - I have a lot hanging over my head these days! - You have a lot hanging over your BELT, too!
dr120530 -- Honeybunch, here's an article from the paper you might be interested in... - "Building a better backside"?? - They show exercises to tone your keister! - Another reason newspapers are superior to the Internet: computers hurt when you get hit
dr120530 -- with one!
dr120531 -- CRACK! - IT'S A FLY BALL TO PATRICK IN RIGHT! - text text text - It used to be, when a kid was "all thumbs" in the outfield, it meant something way different!
dr120601 -- My new driver's license finally arrived! - Hey, there's been a mistake! They put the wrong photo on it! - This is an ugly old fat bald guy!! - Oh, yeah, huh! You're not completely bald!
dr120602 -- Where's the cream cheese your mom asked me to buy? - Actually, dad, she asked you to buy LOW-FAT cream cheese! - Yeah, I know... - But if I do things right, she'll gin confidence in me and start asking me all sorts of things!
dr120603 -- Please empty your pockets and remove your shoes and belts! - Why on earth do we have to go to so much trouble?!! It's all about safety, sir! - Trained security personnel carefully screen each and every passenger before we let them through to
dr120603 -- board the plane! - If we notice any odd or suspicious behavior, that person will be denied entry, and detained for questioning. - GANGWAY! I'M FLYING! I'M FLYING! - How come you let HIM go through? - He's the pilot!
dr120604 -- I love being on the golf course. It's so peaceful and quiet! - WHACK! - CRACK! BONK! SMACK AAUGHH! SPLOOSH - Most of the time!
dr120605 -- - SPLOOSH! Darn! I'm in the lake again! - Cheer up. It happens to the best of us! - It happens to the worst of us more often!
dr120606 -- Uh-oh! That ball is WAY out of bounds! - It went way up into the mountains! - OK, let's go find it! - My dad is the only person I know who needs snow chains on his golf cart! clank clank
dr120607 -- Robert Frost was right... - There's something to be said for taking the road less traveled! - Shut up and help me look for my ball!
dr120608 -- Great drive, dad! Right down the middle of the fairway! - CRACK! - The one time my ball doesn't hit a tree, a tree hits my ball! I can't believe it just fell over!
dr120609 -- Did you play well today, Ralph? - Did I WHAT?? - WAP WAP - Sorry, I had sand in my ears! I'll take that as a "no".
dr120610 -- ARRRGGH! - I hate having to step over that stupid doggie gate! - Can I make a suggestion? - If you remove the gate, you won't have to step over it any more! - And then I'd also be able to go in that room any time I wanted to sleep on the new
dr120610 -- couch or shred magazines! - The gate stays. - People are supposed to be very smart, but I just don't see it!
dr120611 -- - - It should be easier to stick to my diet now that I've thrown out all the junk food! - When mom's on a diet, EVERYONE'S on a diet!
dr120612 -- I'm so disappointed! I just can't lose any weight! I've exercised and skipped meals and I've done everything I'm supposed to do, but so far I haven't lost an ounce! - I can't figure it out! What on earth am I doing wrong? I try and try to eat
dr120612 -- healthy food and I get... Apparently, TALKING doesn't burn up calories!
dr120613 -- I'm so proud of myself! The scale says I've lost five pounds! - I know my dieting has been hard on you all, so tonight we'll celebrate with a pizza! Yes! - But no dessert! Five pounds isn't that much! - I KNEW I should've turned that scale
dr120613 -- back a few more pounds!
dr120614 -- Do you still have that book you were telling me about? Hang on, mother. I'll go check! - - YIKES! What an awful screensaver!! - ?
dr120615 -- Bye, mom! It was good to talk to you again! Bye, June! - Isn't modern technology amazing?? - I can now talk face-to-face with loved ones who are thousands of miles away! - Or, in your mom's case, SEVEN miles away. Just be glad I didn't make
dr120615 -- you go over there!
dr120616 -- Can I have ten bucks, dad? Sure. - Dad, can I have ten dollars, please? Sure, Patrick! - Daddy, can I please have twenty dollars? Sure, Penny! - She always buys me the nicest father day's gift!
dr120617 -- We're back, dad! - Where did you go today? - We had a picnic in the park, went on a nature hike, saw the flower fields, and then went over to Aunt Betty's house for dinner. - What did YOU do all day, dad? - Not much, I watched sports on TV,
dr120617 -- ate chips and junk, then took a nap! - Basically, I just sat around all by myself in my underwear all day. - Thanks for making this the best father's day ever!! Glad you enjoyed yourself!
dr120618 -- ...Sigh... - I think I can now officially call myself a renaissance man. - That's because I look like I'm about five hundred years old!
dr120619 -- MOM! - MOM! - MOTHER! JUNE! HONEYBUNCH! - meow. - Did my kitty just call me?
dr120620 -- - - How on earth do you get your shoes on and off without untying them?? - Years of practice! ...and laziness!
dr120621 -- Hi, Norman. I just called because I was thinking of you. - You were thinking of ME, Wendy? Why?? Today is the longest day of the year... - Which always reminds me of the time you took me on a date to your grandma's house to watch home movies!
dr120621 -- - Talk about a LONG DAY! It's nice to know she thinks of me once a year!
dr120622 -- WHACK! - TWELVE!!! - Aren't you supposed to yell FORE?? - Yeah, but now I'm covered for three bad shots!
dr120623 -- - OW! - HEY, WATCH WHERE YOU AIM THOSE THINGS! - That boy really needs to toughen up!
dr120624 -- It was a nice evening, so honeybunch said... - I have an idea, Ralph! Let's get some exercise and walk to the store! - WALK?? I don't want to walk to the store!! - You always buy a lot of stuff, and I'll have to carry a bunch of heavy old
dr120624 -- bags all the way home! - I promise I won't buy much! - See? All I'm buying is a birthday card! - So how are you doing with that heavy old bag of yours?! - We seem to be doing pretty good, don't we, honeybunch?! smooch! - ...and then it got
dr120624 -- ugly.
dr120625 -- Ralph, we'll be having dinner in ten minutes! - OK, thanks for telling me, honeybunch! - Why did you make a SANDWICH? - I didn't eat lunch today, and I figured out it was now or never!
dr120626 -- It's weird...we've had this grandfather's clock for years. - It chimes all the time, but I never hear it because I'm so used to it! - Ralph, I've told you over and over, when you put your dirty socks in the hamper, make sure they're
dr120626 -- inside-out! - Did someone just say something?
dr120627 -- Souvenirs Son, make sure you marry a woman with a common first name! - How come, dad? - Wherever you go, you'll always be able to buy her one of these souvenir keychains! - Here we go-"June". My anniversary shopping is done!
dr120628 -- Son, if you want to play like a real NBA star, you need to practice! - OK, show me what you can do! - AAAUGHH! - Nice flop! Now give me ten more!
dr120629 -- - - ? - Why do you even bother to put ice cream in a bowl? It's not polite to eat out of the carton!
dr120630 -- Welcome to PSYCHIC BURGER! May I guess your order, please? Sure! - You'd like two cheeseburgers, one order of fries, one onion ring, and two large root beers! - You got it! That'll be $11.25 at the window, please! - Uh-oh! I forgot my wallet!
dr120630 -- I KNEW it!!
dr120701 -- I'm home! - Where have you been, honeybunch? - I went to the beauty shop! - - So what happened? Couldn't they take you? - Enjoy your night on the couch! I meant, because you weren't GONE for long! I mean, not that you'd NEED to be gone for
dr120701 -- long! I mean...good night.
dr120702 -- Dad! I got a summer job! I'm an actor! An actor?? - You tried that last summer when you landed a role at the PAGEANT OF THE PAINTERS! - You portrayed Washington crossing the Delaware! All you had to do was stand still for 90 seconds. It was a
dr120702 -- disaster! - It's not MY fault my cell phone rang! No, but you didn't have to ANSWER it!
dr120703 -- I got an acting job at the Murder Mystery Diner Theater, dad! What's that? - People come for dinner, but the waiters and some of the guests are really actors! - during the meal, a murder is discovered, and a "whodunit" unfolds. Everyone is a
dr120703 -- suspect! - Doesn't that sound like fun? Depends what they're having for dinner?
dr120704 -- The Mystery Diner Theatre is fun, dad! Actors pose as ordinary customers... - During the meal, a 'whodunit' unfolds! Everyone is a suspect! - I play TROY, the handsome newlywed who is madly in love with his new bride. - ...or IS he? (insert
dr120704 -- ominous music here).
dr120705 -- So, you're playing a newlywed husband? That's right, dad. - Who plays your wife? I don't know. I'm going to meet her this afternoon! - I hope she's pretty! In the script, she gives me a big kiss! - WENDY?? Can I trade roles with someone?
dr120706 -- Beverly, my darling... - Thank you for marrying me! - I'm the yuckiest man in the world! - Wait...I think that's supposed to be LUCKIEST! You were right the first time.
dr120707 -- So, where is the dinner theater you're going to be performing at? - It's on a BOAT! The show takes place during a harbor cruise! - That should be interesting... - Considering you get SEASICK! Whatever! The show must go on!
dr120708 -- 555-3629! 555-3629! - Hi, honeybu... Don't say anything, Ralph! I'm trying to remember a phone number! - 444-3629! 555-3629! What FOR? - 555-362*4*! I just wanted to tell you that I already ATE! - 555-362*8*! The had a deal at the Taco Place!
dr120708 -- TWO-FOR-ONE! - 555-3*241*! This is kind of fun!
dr120709 -- This murder dinner mystery cruise will be so much fun, Ralph! - Some of the diners are really actors, and during the meal, a mystery will unfold. - Half the fun is trying to figure out who the actors are! - I'm already a little suspicious
dr120709 -- of the astronaut!
dr120710 -- It's about time for us to go on, Norman! do you know your lines? - Yes, but should we rehearse the kissing scene, Wendy? NO! - By the way, can I have a breath mint? Sure, but you don't need it! - I know. here!
dr120711 -- Do you know all your lines, Norman? You have the main part-you play the murderer! - Norman? Are you OK? Is it my imagination, or is the boat rocking? - The waves are choppy. Let's go! I hear our cue! I'm getting seasick! - WHY WOULD YOU TAKE
dr120711 -- A JOB AS AN ACTOR ON A CRUISE IF YOU GET SEASICK??! Come to think of it, I also get strage fright!
dr120712 -- Ohh...I don't feel so good! I just heard our cue! We're on!! - I'm too seasick! I can't go on! You're the murderer! You HAVE to go on!! - One way or another, you're going out there!! - Oh, look, darling! There's our table! Don't I have an
dr120712 -- understudy?
dr120713 -- Norman looks kind of sickly! I'm sure it's all part of the act! - Hello, everyone! We just got married! - Kiss me, darling! Tell me you're as happy as I am! - Bleah! Boy, he's a good actor! What kind of dinner show is this??
dr120714 -- Norman, it's YOU LINE! Say something! - Ladies, and gentlemen, I have a confession to make! I am the murderer! - I can no longer carry this secret. I have a very guilty conscience, even though I'm just an actor! - I hope you enjoyed our
dr120714 -- murder mystery harbor cruise! They haven't even served the entree yet!
dr120715 -- - - - - TEE-SHIRTS - My other dog is a Rottweiler

dr120720 -- - SPLOOSH! - - I wonder if cats ever get embarrassed? I'm guessing no.
dr120721 -- ...Sigh... - I'm getting old. - I used to think youth was wasted on the young. - Now I think middle age is wasted on the middle-aged!
dr120722 -- This is a very bumpy ride! - Look! I can't put my lipstick on straight, like I usually can in the car! - And I can't sign a birthday card legibly if I'm running late for the party, like I usually am! - And the way this seat is positioned, I
dr120722 -- can't reach over and honk the horn like I usually do! - No, this will never work! - How was the test drive? Apparently, this is not the car for us! - Also, it needs to be a brighter color so I can find it i the bulk club parking lot!
dr120723 -- ...Sigh... - I'm fat and balding and silly-looking! - I'm not the man I used to be! - Who do you think you used to be, exactly?
dr120724 -- I'm here to see Dr. Mercy! - Sign in, please! - Can you sign me in? I think my hand is broken! - Actually, I just didn't want to use the same pen all these sick people signed in with!
dr120725 -- First you go to the waiting room where you wait and wait and wait. - Then they finally come get you... - And take you to a little exam room where you wait and wait and wait some more. - On the bright side, there have probably been many
dr120725 -- advances in medical science since I've been here!
dr120726 -- Nothin is scarier than waiting for test results from your doctor. - If I'm OK, I promise to lead a healthier lifestyle! I'll never revert to my old ways again! - Good news, Mr. Drabble. You're fine! YES!! - GREASEBURGER
dr120727 -- The worst part about getting a shot from the doctor isn't the needle... - It's pulling off the bandage afterward! Just yank it and get it over with! People with hairy arms shouldn't get shots! Tie it to the ceiling fan, like you did with my
dr120727 -- loose tooth!

dr120818 -- This is amazing! The airport security scanners went all out on their awards banquet! - How many times do you get to walk on a RED CARPET? - In my case, every day! Oh, yeah...the donut shop considers you a V.I.P.! Welcome to the 2012 FRISKY
dr120818 -- Awards
dr120819 -- Son, you can tall a lot about a man by where he keeps his sunglasses. - Huh?? Take that guy, for instance... - He puts his sunglasses on top of his head. That shows insecurity. He's afraid to move them too far from his face! - This guy hangs
dr120819 -- them on the front of his shirt. That shows confidence! - This man puts them on the back of his collar. That means he's hiding something! - He puts them in his shirt pocket. That indicates organization and intelligence! - Where do you put YOUR
dr120819 -- sunglasses, dad? - In my back pocket!
dr120820 -- There it is, honeybunch! The FRISKY AWARD Trophy! - It's presented to the Airport Screener of the Year! - A bronzed rubber glove?? - It would look great above our fireplace! Or IN it!
dr120821 -- Do you think you'll win the award, Ralph? Probably not. - I've never won an award. - The closest I ever came was getting my tenderfoot badge in cub scouts. - But I had to return it when my pinewood derby car was disqualified for exceeding the
dr120821 -- weight limit! I'm glad you've gotten over it!
dr120822 -- They're about to announce the winner, Ralph! Maybe it'll be YOU! No chance, honeybunch! - I'm not the kind of guy who wins awards. I never get any respect. And the winner is... - ...not RALPH DRABBLE! THAT'S ME! THAT'S ME! THAT'S... -
dr120822 -- Wait...what? You have to admit that was pretty funny!
dr120823 -- And the winner of the Airport Security Screener Award is...NO-NECK! YES!! - Thank you! I am humbled to receive this award! - I'll put it next to my Mall Cop of the Year award and my Security Guard of the Year Award! - OH YEAH! WHO DA MAN?!!
dr120823 -- Yeah, that seems to have humbled him!
dr120824 -- Thank you for this award, but there is a man who deserves it more than I do. - A man who is overlooked year after year, but is a shining example of professionalism! - It's high time we recognize him and give him the credit he deserves... -
dr120824 -- SPANKY HERRERA! TAKE A BOW, SPANKY! ...Sigh... CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP
dr120825 -- ...and in conclusion, I'd like to acknowledge the other person... - He is one of the best airport security screeners around! He taught me everything I know... - RALPH DRABBLE! At last, some recognition! - Unfortunately, No-Neck's speech was
dr120825 -- so long, everyone else went home! Give him a big hand!
dr120826 -- Hi, mom! It's me! - I just wanted to call and say thank you for the wonderful birthday gifts! - I love the shirt that says "I'm with stupid". - And ate "I'm with stupid" cap. - The "I'm with stupid" apron is a riot... drum drum drum - And so
dr120826 -- is the "I'm with stupid" mug! - I must say, you're very easy to shop for! I know, but still... - This is why the concept of MOTHER-IN-LAWS DAY will never catch on!
dr120827 -- I've come down to the pawn shop today to try to sell a rare item! - Hello! I have a rare historical artifact that I would be willing to sell for the right price! - It is so valuable, I locked it inside this briefcase, and handcuffed it to my
dr120827 -- wrist! - Unfortunately, I also locked the keys inside, so you'll have to take my word for it! They all come here.
dr120828 -- So, what did you want to sell? I have in my possession the signature of Abraham Lincoln! - If it's authentic, it could be quite valuable! It's authentic, all right! - Is it signed in a book? Or on a letter? Or on a document of some kind?
dr120828 -- Even better... - He signed a baseball!
dr120829 -- What would make you think that Abraham Lincoln signed a baseball? - He probably threw out the first pitch at a Washington Nationals game! - The Washington Nationals weren't around when Lincoln was president! Oh, yeah, huh! - Then it must have
dr120829 -- been the Washington Senators!
dr120830 -- Where did you get this baseball signed by Abraham Lincoln? I bought it at a garage sale! - I immediately recognized the historical significance, and I negotiated the price down to $250! - I've never seen Lincoln's signature on a major league
dr120830 -- baseball! - I've also never seen it signed with a ballpoint pen! The value keeps rising!
dr120831 -- So you paid $250 at a garage sale for a baseball signed by ABRAHAM LINCOLN?? - That's right, and I'll sell it to you right now for $100,000! - Do you mind if I call in a buddy of mineto look at it? Is he a handwriting expert? - No, but he
dr120831 -- could use a good laugh! Make it snappy before my price goes up!
dr120901 -- I hate to tell you, but this baseball was NOT signed by Abraham Lincoln. WHAT?? - It HAS to be real! I paid $250 for it at a garage sale!! - Trust me, Abraham Lincoln NEVER signed this baseball! DANG! - I was afraid to ask him about my hockey
dr120901 -- puck signed by General Custer!
dr120902 -- I weigh exactly 249 pounds. - Hand me a donut, Norm! - I still weigh 249 pounds. - Hand me another one! - Still 249. Hand me another! - 249. One more! - *250*! OK, take one back! - I can eat three donuts without gaining a pound! You're so
dr120902 -- careful about what you eat, I'm surprised you never lose weight!
dr120903 -- Today is traditionally the last day of summer! - It's still warm. I hate to deflate the pool! - What do you think, honeybunch? Is it time to say goodbye to summer? - * It's the most wonderful time... * I'll take that as a "yes".
dr120904 -- chirp chirp! - Good luck to my kids in school this year. - chirp chirp! - some of them will need lot more than others. I'm kind of sorry I taught my dad how to tweet!
dr120905 -- Whenever I see one of these blood pressure machines, I use it! - Dang! It's a little higher than usual! - The car mechanic's waiting room might not be the best place for this! Bad news! It's gonna be another $300!
dr120906 -- chirp chirp! - - Why did you look at this text? Turn off your phone in class!! - A parent's work is never done!
dr120907 -- - HAS IT BEEN 30 MINUTES YET? - When the doctor told you to spend a half hour each day on the treadmill, he meant with it TURNED ON!

dr120909 -- swim! - 7. We've got time. Hit another! - 8. Have you ever considered bowling?
dr120910 -- Here's an interesting fact... - Ralph, listen to this... - A big meal will temporarily make our sense of hearing less sharp! - EH?
dr120911 -- boodle-dee-oop! ...Sigh... - - Hmmmno text message! - I need to pick a new text alert that doesn't sound like a noise my stomach makes. burble-urble!

dr120914 -- - - - - BUFFET Please Use a Clean Plate! I will if I can find one!
dr120915 -- You've been drinking a lot of sodas, Norm! - There's a recycling machine at the supermarket that gives you 5c per can! - The more cans we empty, the more money we make! psschht! - This explains his grade in economics! Mom! You need to go buy
dr120915 -- more soda again!
dr120916 -- - push! push! push! -  push! push! push! push! push! push! push! push! push! - ...Sigh... - Excuse me... - push - blink! - That's gonna bug me all day!
dr120917 -- ...Sigh... - There's only one thing worse than shopping at bulk club with all three of my kids on a crowded afternoon... - And that's shopping with my husband! - Wait, why do we need three big rolls of tape?
dr120918 -- Shopping at Bulk Club with my husband can be a trying experience! - Ralph! Stop touching things! - Get back here where you belong! - Now I understand why the carts at Bulk Club are larger!
dr120919 -- Here, Ralph. Have a hot dog and a soda! - Sit there and enjoy your lunch, and I'll come back to get you! - That's the reason there's a food court in Bulk Club-wives can shop in peace! - I'm done. GO BACK AND GET A CHURRO!
dr120920 -- Get me a sack of flour, please, Ralph! - Wow, that's heavy! - Hey, bring back that cart!! Meet me in the procure department!
dr120921 -- Turn down this aisle, Ralph! - shuffle! shuffle! shuffle! - You're done shopping when you can no longer turn the cart! I said, turn down this aisle!

dr120923 -- of the day!
dr120924 -- There are a lot of good shows on tonight, dad! - If I were you, I'd settle into my easy chair with a big bowl of popcorn... - And I wouldn't leave it, no matter what! - Please? Sorry, son, but I wouldn't miss the opportunity to embarrass
dr120924 -- my children at 'back-to-school' night!
dr120925 -- I was a big hit at back-to-school night, Patrick! - While your mom went to Penny's class, I went to yours! - I told the teacher you were the smartest kid on earth, and then I entertained her with my Jim Rome impression! - She'll never forget
dr120925 -- me! Fortunately, I gave him the wrong room number.
dr120926 -- ...or else I could go to the mall AFTER I go to the dentist. - Yes, THAT'S what I'll do! - Sometimes I just need to hear myself talk! - Too bad you're not me. I get to hear you all day long!
dr120927 -- Do you have any specials tonight for "Taco Tuesday"? - No. How come? - It's Thursday. Oh, yeah, huh. - And this is an Italian restaurant! It never hurts to ask!
dr120928 -- skattle skattle skattle skattle skattle skattle skattle skattle skattle - zzyzx! - No wonder Wally always seems so tired... - When he's not running around, he's DREAMING he's running around! skattle skattle skattle
dr120929 -- Look, Wally! I bought a stuffed toy for you! - GRRRR! - RIP! TEAR! SHREAD! - NEXT! He got 8 seconds of fun out of it!
dr120930 -- Dad, why do You wear crazy outfits on the golf course? - It gives me a competitive edge! - It creates a distraction for my opponents! Instead of concentrating on their game, they're thinking about what I'm wearing! - Take my friend No-Neck,
dr120930 -- for instance. I beat him every time we play golf! Why? Because my outrageous attire disrupts his concentration! - You just watch! I'm going to beat him today, too! - We'll see about that, Ralph!
dr121001 -- Dad, guess what! I'm a collegiate athlete! - I made the team! WHAT team? - The intramural co-ed innertube water plo team! - Our first match is Thursday at 4:00, if you'd like to come watch me! Dang! I just happen to be free at that time!
dr121002 -- Norm, why do you sign up to play on a intramural co-ed innertube water polo team? It sounded like fun, dad! - Besides, it's a great way to meet women! What woman wouldn't be impressed?
dr121003 -- Dad, I'm practicing to play goalie for the intramural co-ed innertube water polo team! - Go ahead, dad! Take your best shot! If you insist! - BAM! - Shall I take another? OK, but this time, take your third or fourth-best shot!
dr121004 -- HI, NORMAN!! ECHO!! - I didn't know you played co-ed intramural innertube water polo! I'm the other team's goalie! - Gee, I almost hate to do this... Do what? - GOOOOAALLL!!
dr121005 -- I'm sorry about that goal I scored against you, Norman! - Yeah, that was kind of unfair, Echo! - I was surprised to see you, and I got all distracted, and... - GOOOOAAALLL!! HEY!!
dr121006 -- You're a very good water polo goalie, Norman! - I'm sorry about that first goal I scored against you. You were distracted and it wasn't fair. - Neither was the SECOND goal you scored against me! - THE OTHER 15 GOALS WERE PRETTY LEGIT, THOUGH!
dr121007 -- I'll be back in a while! - Honeybunch, do you remember the time we went to a fancy party... - And afterward you realized that you had forgotten to put on your makeup... - And you were horrified that you went out in public looking so
dr121007 -- terrible... - And you told me that if you ever tried to leave the house again looking that bad, that I should tell you? - Yes. Well, I just need to say... - You look great! - Wimp. I prefer to think of myself as a survivor!
dr121008 -- I know you're excited for Halloween, but it's only October 8th! It's too early to start wearing your costume. - ...assuming that's a costume! Sorry! I just can't wait!
dr121009 -- I'm done with my shower! OK. - I need to look into the mirror before I go to work! - Not bad! - At my age, I only look in the mirror when it's fogged-up!
dr121010 -- Daddy, can we get a pumpkin? - It's still too early, Penny! - Halloween CANDY Yes! My favorite! If it's too early for a pumpkin, it's too early for Halloween candy! -
dr121011 -- And on Friday, my sister's family is coming for dinner. - Then on Saturday we're spending the day at my mother's! - BLAM! - Another stress ball bites the dust!
dr121012 -- Here, dad. Hold this! - Perfect! That can be your Halloween costume this year! - What am I supposed to be? - A "before" picture!
dr121013 -- - Can I throw away this graduation announcement from 2011? - Not yet. I keep forgetting to send a gift! - I don't know what's older: The stuff IN the refrigerator, or the stuff ON the refrigerator!
dr121014 -- I'm really looking forward to having dinner at this new restaurant, Ralph! - Uh-oh... What? - I forgot my wallet! - I guess we'll have to drive all the way home! ...Sigh... - I can't believe it! I've been doing all sorts of dumb things
dr121014 -- lately! - What's WRONG with me?? - Well, you're irresponsible, yo...tting old, you're not the brightest sp...to begin with, you're somewhat car...thinking about something stupid, you...brain called, you're embarrassingly ... clueless, you tend
dr121014 -- to space out like a...and you are very easily distracted...ax, and another thing... That probably wasn't the best question to pose to my wife!
dr121015 -- Why doesn't the ref blow the whistle?! - Steinbauer is a lousy referee.  He doesn't see a thing! - I WILL NOT TOLERATE VERBAL ABUSE FROM THE PARENTS! CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED! - He HEARS everything, though!
dr121016 -- Bad call, ref! That's all I'm going to take from you, Ralph! - What are you going to do? Give me a yellow card? Better... - DUCT TAPE! Leave that over your mouth for 15 MINUTES! - PLAY ON! Dang! I'm going to miss the halftime snack!
dr121017 -- The soccer ref put duct tape over my mouth! How am I supposed to show my displeasure? - I'll intimidate him with my eyes! - -
dr121018 -- The ref put tape over my mouth because I was critical of his officiating! - He can't see what's happening on the field, but he can hear every comment from the sidelines! - Soccer refs compensate for their poor vision by sharpening their other
dr121018 -- senses! - I PERCEIVED THAT THOUGHT!
dr121019 -- PUT IN YOUR CONTACTS, REF!! - 15-minute duct tape penalty for Mrs. Drabble! - skrik! Uh-oh. It's been a rough game! - I don't have enough tape left to cover her entire mouth! No comment from me!
dr121020 -- Your 15-minute penalty is over! - I'll remove the tape from your mouth! - RIP! - OW! That's my favorite part!
dr121021 -- - - - - - - You'd finish a lot quicker if you'd use a rake, dad! - Id your grandma still here? Yes, she's showing everyone her vacation photos. - I'll do it this way!
dr121022 -- I like the early morning! - Honeybunch looks so peaceful when she's asleep! - I'd better be quiet! It would be a shame to wake her up and shatter such blissful tranquility. - Not hers, MINE!
dr121023 -- skattle skattle - skattle skattle - Pardon Wally. He's a little hyper! - Sometimes it's best to acknowledge the wiener dog in the room! skattle skattle skattle skattle skattle
dr121024 -- - It looked better at the pumpkin farm! - Don't tell me...please don't tell me... - She's actually exchanging a pumpkin!
dr121025 -- - - ACHOO! - Does anyone have a tissue? OH, FOR HEAVEN SAKES!
dr121026 -- - carve carve carve - We should have bought a bigger pumpkin! How come? - I've only carved one eye and I'm already running out of room!
dr121027 -- I don't know whether to eat a bowl of ice cream BEFORE I rake the leaves or AFTER. - If I eat it now, I can burn off the calories! But if you wait, you'll probably enjoy it more! - I've reached the perfect compromise! - I'll eat a bowl of ice
dr122027 -- cream while NORMAN rakes the leaves!
dr121028 -- Have you ever heard about "The Missiles of October"? Sure! - In our house, it's the MISTLETOE of October! - Can't we get past HALLOWEEN before you start putting up the CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS?
dr121029 -- I've got to hand it to you, honeybunch...I've looked all through this house and I still haven't found where you hid the Halloween candy! - Congratulations! It took many years, but I finally discovered the best place to hide something from
dr121029 -- Ralph!
dr121030 -- Trick or treat! Last year you ate all the Halloween candy before we got here, so you told us to come early this year! - Not THIS early!!
dr121031 -- Trick or treat! Sorry, kid. You're way too late! - You must be new to the neighborhood! I always eat all the candy before anyone gets here! - But here's a souvenir of your visit! - I trick-or-treated at Ralph Drabble's house and all I got was
dr121031 -- this lousy t-shirt!
dr121101 -- Thanks again for rescuing me! - Nightfall was coming and panic was setting in. I'm glad my cell phone still had reception! - At least you'll have a story to tell! Yeah, but I probably won't! I'm sure you're not the first person to call 9-1-1
dr121101 -- after getting lost in a corn maze!
dr121102 -- WALLY! - WALLY! - How come you never come when I call your name? That's my name? - I thought my name was "Wally, you dumb dog"!
dr121103 -- And another thing, when something isn't good, why do they call it CHEESY? Or a bunch of BALONEY? Or CORNY? And why is a bad actor called a HAM? - Quiet! Somebody's coming! - It's probably time to clean out the fridge when the food starts
dr121103 -- conversing!
dr121104 -- SUPERMARKET No waiting on checkstand 3! - Well! What have we here? - "You are the love of my life, my one and only..." - HEY, BOBBY! COME TAKE A LOOK AT *THIS* ONE! - OH, GIMME THAT CARD BACK!! - A guy should never take a mushy card for his
dr121104 -- wife to a male check-out clerk! - sniff! ...Sigh...
dr121105 -- ...and the contestant going home tonight is... - HEY! THE SHOW STOPPED! Not again! What happened?! - The show ran long and the DVR stopped recording! - That's reason #86 why TV was better when I was a kid! What are the other reasons, dad?
dr121105 -- Don't get him started!
dr121106 -- I can't believe it! The DVR stopped recording right before they announced which contestant was voted off! - I guess the show ran a little too long! - How on earth could the RESULTS SHOW run too long?? - There's only one minute of SHOW, and 59
dr121106 -- minutes of FILLER! Apparently, tonight they had *59.5* minutes of filler!
dr121107 -- TV was better when I was a kid! They had *TV* when you were a kid, dad? - Yes they did, and everything was better about it! - Did you have remote control? Of course I had a remote control!! - It was a long stick!
dr121108 -- TV was way better when I was a kid! - Nowadays, you never know what kind of objectionable material will appear on the screen! - When I was a kid, parents could leave their kids in front of the TV for hours on end! - And that was a GOOD
dr121108 -- thing?? Actually, my mother set a strict limit of only 12 hours a day!
dr121109 -- TV shows were better when I was a kid! Today they all rely on crude humor! - TV writers who resort to gross-out gags are admitting that they have no talent! - Excerpt from 10-25 Drabble-Ed. ACHOO! Does anyone have a tissue? Oh, for heaven's
dr121109 -- sake! I said *TV* writers, not COMIC STRIP writers!
dr121110 -- Dad, how can you say TV was better when you were a kid?! - When you were a kid, you only got to watch "It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown" once a year! - When it was over, you had to wait twelve months to see it again! - We can watch it
dr121110 -- over and over and over! He's got me there!
dr121111 -- Time for my annual tradition... - Every year, I try to "kick" my age. - I'm 45, so this year, I will attempt a 45-yard field goal! - So far, I've never missed! The day I can't make it is the day I'm officially an old man! - BOOT! - - - Well?
dr121111 -- Are you still young? I couldn't tell. Apparently I'm old enough to need glasses!
dr121112 -- Thank you all for coming to our neighborhood emergency preparedness team! - Every day, we hear reports of fires, floods and earthquakes. - But if we look out for each other, we might be able to withstand the next disaster! - Sorry I'm late.
dr121112 -- Where are the snacks? - Speaking of disasters! Hi, Mr. Steinbauer.
dr121113 -- Emergency Preparedness Meeting Come In! The key to preparing for an emergency is to get our neighborhood organized! - I will server as BLOCK CAPTAIN! Wait a minute! Why are YOU the block captain?? - I think *I* should be in a position of
dr121113 -- leadership! OK, Steinbauer! - You can be the BLOCKHEAD! That's more like it! Wait-what?
dr121114 -- It's important to prepare for a disaster BEFORE it happens! - What would you do if your water supply was cut off? - No problem! I've got a 100-foot hose. I'd just attach it to my neighbor's spigot, and take all the water I want! - That might
dr121114 -- not work, Steinbauer! It DOES work! How do you think I keep my water bills so low?!
dr121115 -- To prepare for a disaster, we should all have a six-month supply of food in our garage! - Do YOU have a six-month supply, Ralph? I most certainly do! - Come to think of it, it's more like a TWO-month supply! - I've been doing some snacking!
dr121115 -- No wonder you spend so much time in the garage!
dr121116 -- The key to surviving a disaster is having neighbors who care about one another! - Speaking of that, did you ever find a job, Sulpherdale? As a matter of fact, I did. - Good! Then you'll have no excuse for not buying my daughter's girl scout
dr121116 -- cookies next year! - Well, maybe YOU should buy a muzzle for your stupid dog! Whose dog are you calling stupid?!! This disaster meeting is a disaster!
dr121117 -- I'm passing around a sign-up sheet... - Every neighbor should write their name and phone number so we can contact each other in case of emergency! - I'm not going to give out personal information! I'll end up on some telemarketing list! - How
dr121117 -- do YOU suggest we contact each other after a disaster? Let's practice our screaming!
dr121118 -- WALLY - Purrrrr - Purrrrr - ROWF! - - Almost. - POOMF! - Just two inches from the ceiling! I'll have to bark louder next time!
dr121119 -- They posted the playoff schedule for intramural co-ed inntertube water polo! - Oh, no! Our team is scheduled to play Echo's team in the first round! - The last time I played goalie against Echo's team, she scored 17 goals against me! - She's
dr121119 -- pretty good! Hey, one of those goals was just LUCK!
dr121120 -- Remember, Norman, if we lose this game, we're out of the playoffs! - There's no tomorrow! It's do or die! - If you play as poorly against Echo's team as you did last time, we'll cut you from the team and never speak to you again! - Thanks for
dr121120 -- the pep talk. And we'll pop your innertube!
dr121121 -- Hey, Echo, you know how you scored 17 goals against me last game? *18*, but who's counting? - This time, don't try so hard to score on me, OK? Why?? That would be patronizing! - I'd be treating you as an inferior! You wouldn't want me to do
dr121121 -- that, would you? - Well? WOULD YOU?? I'm thinking it over!
dr121122 -- I can't believe Norman asked me to go easy on him while he plays goalie! - Why would he not want me to play to my full potential? - It's just a game! Why would... - Remember, Norman, if Echo scores another 17 goals against you, you're off the
dr121122 -- team!
dr121123 -- If I score a bunch of goals against Norman, they'll throw him off the team! - But it wrong not to play to my full potential! - SHOOT, ECHO! SHOOT!! - NICE PASS! Whew!
dr121124 -- I have a wide open shot! - If I score, Norman's tram will lose and he'll get the blame. If I DON'T shoot, everyone will know I took pity on him! - There's only one thing to do! -
dr121125 -- - - - What's wrong with you? - I'm trying to be a jerk! - Earlier you got mad at me and told me not to be a jerk, so I've been trying ever since! - It's not working! - Telling someone not to be a jerk is like telling someone not to think of a
dr121125 -- purple elephant!
dr121126 -- - I missed! How did THAT happen?? I never miss! - I won't miss next time! - CO-ed intramural innertube water polo is not for the faint of heart!
dr121127 -- I've missed two shots in a row! What's going on here?? - Could it be that I'm subconsciously afraid to score because it would make Norman look like a bad goalie? - No. - I'm CONSCIOUSLY afraid of it!
dr121128 -- Norman, I overheard your teammates tell you they'd cut you from the team if I scored a bunch of goals. - That's why I haven't been able to shoot straight today! - GOOOAAALL! - Whew! Now that I know what the problem is, I feel so much better!
dr121128 -- Crud!

dr130408 -- A cat makes the very best pet, and this you must never forget. - Dogs can be mean, - but cats are serene. - Except on the way to the vet!
dr130409 -- The reason that people love cats, is simple. Let's look at the stats. - We sleep most of the day, - We wake up just to play. - And we make sure your house has no rats!
dr130410 -- People think cats are so dignified, we seem calm and collected inside. - But when I went to the groomer - He made me wish I'd left sooner. snip snip - 'cause now I'm just fit to be tied!

dr130424 -- RELAX! I'LL BE THERE IN A SECOND! - Betht wisheths! You're supposed to greet the newlyweds BEFORE you get your food!
dr130425 -- I hate social gatherings. Me too, son. It's hard for me to talk to strangers. - But we need to make the effort! Everyone needs to step out of their comfort zone occasionally! - That's my problem dad... - I don't HAVE a comfort zone! MY
dr130425 -- comfort zone is the area around the dessert table!
dr130426 -- Social gatherings can be intimidating, son, but don't be shy! - Put yourself out there! I want you to say hello to every person in this room! - You can never embarrass yourself by being polite! Watch me... - Hello, sir! I'm Ralph Drabble! And

dr130430 -- Echo caught the bouquet. That means she'll be the next bride! - I won't even try to catch the garter! That would be a little awkward! - Rats!
dr130501 -- Look, Norman! The dance floor is empty! - I don't know HOW to dance, Echo! I don't, either! - Let's dance like the Peanuts characters in "A Carlie Brown Christmas"! - Good idea, Norman! You're the only person who ever says that, Echo!
dr130502 -- Look! Norman is dancing! - He seems to have a lot in common with that girl! - Yes, they seem perfect for each other! - So, what do you think is going to go wrong? We'll probably find out before the night is over!
dr130503 -- I forgot to ask you, Echo...why are you here at the wedding reception? - I'm related to the bride! - I can't believe how much we have in common! I'm related to the bride, too! -
dr130504 -- We're BOTH related to the bride??? What a coincidence! - But if YOU'RE related to the bride, and I'M related to the bride... - Then WE must be related!! Eww! - I feel like Luke Skywalker when he found out Princess Leia was his sister! I'm

dr130505 -- Strike three! - BOO! GIVE ME A BREAK, UMP! GET IN THE GAME, BLUE! - How come little league parents always give the umpire such a hard time? - Umpires do the best they can! If not for the umpire, the kids couldn't have a game! - It's really
dr130505 -- true: the people who volunteer are always the most criticized! - It's a great idea for the ump to take off his mask, hand it to the biggest loudmouth, and make THAT person do the umpiring until he apologizes! - Definitely a good idea! - Had
dr130505 -- enough? I'll never yell at you again!
dr130506 -- RELATED?? How can we be RELATED, Echo?? - I'm Poopsie's second cousin's half-sister's... - step niece's brother-in-law's aunt's third husband's son-in-law's nephew's cousin once removed! - And that makes you... More confused than usual!
dr130507 -- What's wrong, Norm? I received devastating news, dad! - I just found out that the perfect girl is RELATED to me! - She's Poopsie's second cousin's half-sister's step-niece's brother-in-law's aunt's third husband's son-in-law's nephew's
dr130507 -- cousin once removed! - Bummer! Some things are just not meant to be!
dr130508 -- Norm, it's perfectly OK for you to date Echo! - So what if she's Poopsie's second cousin's half sister's step-niece's... - brother-in-law's aunt's third husband's son-in-law's nephew's cousin twice removed? - She's ONCE removed. Oh, then
dr130508 -- forget it!
dr130509 -- Norman, you are NOT related to Echo! How do you know? - We're not actually related to Poopsie! She's our cousin's STEP-niece! WOW! - Imagine how happy Echo will be! She'll probably want to elope with you TONIGHT! Go tell her the good news! -

dr130512 -- Happy Mother's Day, Mom! We made a card for you! - When it comes to our mom, she is simply the best. Our mom always makes sure that we ace the test! - She'll help us with homework for as long as we please. That's a good 'cause when dad helps,
dr130512 -- we only get "C"s! - For problems and quandaries no need to think twice. She always gives the very best fatherly advice! - Now don't get us wrong, dad has his talents too. But the best thing he's done is say, "I do" to you! - That's the best
dr130512 -- Mother's Day card ever! Sorry to throw you under the bus, dad! On Father's Day, just BUY me a card!
dr130513 -- I gave up donuts a month ago! - What a difference! I feel healthier and more energetic! - And also a little guilty! Ernie's Donuts Out Of Business Closed You and your stupid diet! Please help

dr130516 -- What are you doing? We're making your father's day card, dad. - We're trying to think of why you're the best dad in the world, and it's really hard! - Good thing you're getting an early start! Father's day is a month away! - We've been
dr130516 -- working on this since February!

dr130519 -- Oops! - Rats! - I dropped a jelly bean under the refrigerator! - Now I have to try to knock it back out! - Whoa! - Not only did I retrieve my jelly bean, but I also got a cheese puff, an M&M, a pork rind and something else! - Yum! munch
dr130519 -- munch! "SOMETHING ELSE"??!!
dr130520 -- I'm so stressed! - I've got so much to do today! I'm a total basket-case! - yawn! - You just lie there like that to annoy me, don't you? Maybe!
dr130521 -- All right, all right! Stop staring at me like that! - You can come in! - - I hate to admit it, but you're starting to make me appreciate the cat! It was only a matter of time!
dr130522 -- An empty sack can be fun, the cat said. - For one thing, it can be used as a bed! - It's a good place to hide, a cat looks cool inside. - Except when it gets stuck on his head! Dang!
dr130523 -- Oogie's head is stuck in a scak! - Well, don't just stand there, DO something!! - - Not helpful!
dr130524 -- chop! - Maybe you should slow down your golf swing! - I swing fast on purpose. - I figure the faster I swing, the less time I have to mess it up!
dr130525 -- - - It's hard to believe that back in January, I couldn't wait for this!
dr130526 -- Hmm...it seems like today is important for some reason... Oh, now I remember! - Hey, bro! It's me! - I'm calling to remind you that today is your anniversary! - Hee hee! You're welcome! That's what brothers are for! - Oh, really?? GOSH,

dr130702 -- That broke my heart! I'VE broken a HEART??
dr130703 -- How does my wig look, Norman? Great, Echo! How do *I* look? - Old! It's a good thing we're related! Otherwise we might have ended up married and looking like this! - I fibbed to Echo that we were related! I was afraid things were moving too
dr130703 -- fast! - Echo, I have a confession to make... Quiet, you two! It's SHOWTIME!
dr130704 -- Norman and Echo, remember to have stern facial expressions! - That won't be easy! Just being next to my cousin Norman makes me smile! - By the way, when I said we were related, it wasn't true! You LIED to me?? - PERFECT! HOLD THAT EXPRESSION!
dr130705 -- I can't believe you told me a lie, Norman! I was just trying to...I didn't mean to... - Quiet! The curtain is rising! - All you have to do is stand still and be quiet for TWO MINUTES! - This is going to be the longest two minutes of my life!
dr130706 -- Norman is doing great! Hey, he's with Echo! - He's halfway home! All he has to do is stand perfectly still for one more minute! - LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'D LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS... -
dr130707 -- The count is 3 and 2, bases loaded... - Here's the pitch... - Ball four! He walks in the tying run! DAGNABBIT! I should have never come in the room! - Every time I watch, the team looses! Believe me, honeybunch, it has nothing to do with YOU!
dr130707 -- - The team doesn't know you EXIST, much less when you're watching them on TV! - You really don't have that much power, you know! - ...and now a grand slam has broken the game wide open! WILL YOU PLEASE GET OUT OF HERE BEFORE WE FALL OUT OF
dr130707 -- THE PENNANT RACE?!!
dr130708 -- Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry to interrupt the show... - My name is Norman and her name is Echo! - I told Echo a lie, and I'd like to publicly apologize to her! - That's actually kind of sweet! - QUIT WHILE YOU'RE AHEAD, DUMMY! Allow me to
dr130708 -- elaborate!
dr130709 -- I owe an apology to to my friend, Echo! I will briefly explain why... - It all started when we kept bumping into each other everywhere we went, so we figured it must be fate and we started hanging out together, and we soon realized that we
dr130709 -- had a lot in common so we started to like each other! But then we bumped into each other again at someone's wedding reception and we danced like the Peanuts characters, but then I told her we were related even though I knew we weren't,
dr130709 -- because... - PING! OW! - Did you just hit your brother with a pea? Yes, and you're welcome!
dr130710 -- Darn! The curtain come down before I could finish apologizing! - You stopped the show just so you could publicly apologize to me?? I can't believe you'd do something so ridiculous! - Sorry I lied, Echo! I lied, too! - I CAN believe you'd do
dr120710 -- something so ridiculous!
dr130711 -- All Norman had to do was stand still and keep quiet for two minutes, and he blew it! - Oh, well...try to forget it. Let's hope the rest of the show gets better! - How can it possibly get any WORSE?? - Dad, this is our director... Mr.
dr130711 -- Drabble, how would you like to break into show business tonight?
dr130712 -- Mr. Drabble, one of our models called in sick... - We need a man with your physique to pose as a famous statue! - I suppose I can do that! Great! - Take off your clothes. WHAT??!
dr130713 -- I'm back! I thought they were going to put you in the show! - They wanted me to pose as a statue, but I would've had to take off my clothes and wear bronze bodypaint! - So, what happened? - They didn't have enough paint!
dr130714 -- Get out of my chair, you dumb dog! - - What's wrong, Wally? - Do you need to go outside? - ...Sigh... All right! - There. - HEY! - If Wally's dumb, what does that make you?
dr130715 -- Here's your burger...hey! Why are you in Ralph's car?! - CALL THE POLICE! WE NEED TO REPORT a STOLEN VEHICLE!! - I'm his wife. Oh. Sorry! - So, how's your diet coming, Ralph? Fine. Why?

dr130722 -- What's for dinner, honeybunch? It's a new recipe. - Toasted sesame ginger salmon! - I've been working on it all day! Darn! I was hoping for hot dogs! - She could've unwrapped them first!
dr130723 -- Darn! I'm having such a bad day! - Sorry. - Ralph, stop apologizing for everything! It drives me crazy! - Sorry. That's better!
dr130724 -- For heaven's sake, Ralph! You put the paper towels upside-down! - The flower pattern is supposed to go along the BOTTOM. - It's getting so I can't ask you to do ANYTHING around here! - That's the idea!
dr130725 -- WHIRRRR - Ah-ha! - The most important club in my bag is a weed whacker!
dr130726 -- - WHACK! - SPLASH! - I don't lose as many balls since I started putting tiny life jackets on them!
dr130727 -- - Whoa! - You dumb dog! Why are you always under my feet?? - Just trying to stay in the shade!

dr130729 -- ...if Ralph Drabble sinks this putt, he'll win the Masters! - It looks good... - But another ball knocks it off course!! - Sorry. My bad! You sure spoiled THAT fantasy!
dr130730 -- Norm, when you're putting o the practice green... - Always be respectful of the other golfers! - Every guy out here is fantasizing that he's putting to win a major tournament! - WILL YOU GUYS PIPE DOWN?! I'M TRYING TO WIN THE BRITISH OPEN!
dr130730 -- See?
dr130731 -- PUTT! - PUTT! PUTT! PUTT! PUTT! PUTT! PUTT! PUTT! - Would you like a bigger cup?
dr130801 -- WHACK! - DANG! DANG! DANG! WHAM! - Why do you even come to the driving range? It helps me unwind!
dr130802 -- Ralph, there's a golf tournament in town next week! I know. - You should enter it! Me?? WHY?? - Because it has always been your dream to compete in a real golf tournament! - What have you got to lose? A few dozen balls!
dr130803 -- You're entering a golf tournament?? Yeah, I've never played in one before! - Visualization is the key. Before every shot, try to visualize the outcome! - - Believe me, I do! I should've said, the DESIRED outcome!
dr130804 -- WALLY! - Relax, Wally! - Calm down! - Just because I put on my shoes and jacket, it doesn't mean I'm taking you for a walk! - - ...Sigh...
dr130805 -- I hear you're entering the golf tournament, Ralph! That's right, Steinbauer! - I'm the defending champion, you know! Really?? I didn't know you were a great golfer! - I'm not, but I psychout my opponents! I'll be stuck in your head like a
dr130805 -- Barry Manilow song! - By the way, did you fix the hitch in your swing? I have a hitch in my swing??
dr130806 -- I'm going to the beach to practice my sand trap shots! - You can't hit golf balls on the beach! I can't? - Where can I practice hitting out on the golf sand?? - Please hurry! BOOF! Oogie
dr130807 -- Norm, I'd like you to be my caddy for the golf tournament! Why me? - You can't overestimate the value of a good caddy! - The caddy measures yardage, selects the club and offers advice! - Yeah, and he also gets blamed when the golfer flubs a
dr130807 -- shot! Only in major tournaments!
dr130808 -- Good luck, Ralph! Try not to think about the fact that I'm the defending champion! Welcome To the EASTBAY OPEN - As a token of my goodwill, have some new golf balls! Thanks, Steinbauer! - They aren't good enough for me, but they're plenty
dr130808 -- good enough for you! - Besides, I only need one! He just got into my head, didn't he?
dr130809 -- Now at the first tee, defending champion George Steinbauer! WHACK! - Oh, wat a TERRIBLE shot! That was WAY beneath my standards! - What do you mean?? The ball landed in the middle of the fairway in perfect position! - I wanted it to land with
dr130809 -- the brand name up!
dr130810 -- Next up on the tee...Ralph Drabble! Whatever you do, don't hit in the sand trap! - WHACK! SPLASH! - You were so concerned about the sand trap, you overcompensated and hit it into the lake! Too bad, Ralph! - I'm no match for his mind-games!
dr130810 -- OBI-WAN-KENOBI is no match for his mind-games!
dr130811 -- ...Yawn... - What are you reading? - It's my book club selection. Our meeting is tomorrow and I really need to finish it! - Is it good? Yes. - What's it about? It's hard to explain. - How many pages does it have? Maybe I'll go read in the
dr130811 -- other room! -
dr130812 -- My dream of winning a golf tournament has turned into a nightmare! * - I can't do anything right! Steinbauer has me totally psyched-out! - He warned me that he'd be stuck in my head like a Barry Manilow song! DAD, THAT'S IT!! - In order to
dr130812 -- win this golf tournament, you must trust me and do as I say! Egads!
dr130813 -- Mr. Steinbauer said he'd be stuck in your head like a Barry Manilow song... - He's psyching you out! So what should I do?? - SING BARRY MANILOW SONGS! You'll stop thinking about Steinbauer and you'll relax! - Try it! What have you got to
dr130813 -- lose? My dignity and my mind!
dr130814 -- My tee shot landed two feet from the cup! Try to beat THAT, Ralph! - Remember, sing Barry Manilow songs! - * Oh, Copacabana.. ** - An INCH from the cup!!! * Oh, it's a miracle... ***
dr130815 -- Ralph Drabble has made a remarkable comeback! * Oh, at the Copa... * - After falling behind early, he has closed the gap! * Oh, I write the songs * - He has nearly wiped out Steinbauer's lead! * Oh, Mandy * - * Looks like we made it... * WILL
dr130815 -- YOU QUIT SINGING BARRY MANILOW SONGS?!
dr130816 -- I have to admit, Norm, your strategy has worked! - Golf is a mental game, and it's easy to let negative thoughts creep into your mind. - Singing Barry Manilow songs is a great way to keep my mind unoccupied! There only seems to be one
dr130816 -- problem... - It's hard to putt with tears in your eyes! * Oh, last night I said good-bye... * *
dr130817 -- This is the biggest putt of Ralph Drabble's life... * Oh, like a good neighbor.. * -If he makes it, he'll win the tournament! * you deserve a break today... * putt! - tokkl-okkl! - I DID IT!! Not so fast...
dr130818 -- Yes, our picture is back on now! Thank you for your help! - I'll never understand how you are able to fix our cable box over the phone! - Where's your office, anyway? - Oh, really? I thought the cable company was right here in town! - That's
dr130818 -- amazing! You sound like you're practically next door! I never would've guessed you were so far away! - What's the weather like there? - My wife is the reason there's always a 25-minute wait when you call customer service!
dr130819 -- Congratulations to Ralph Drabble, this year's champion! Not so fast... - The rule box states a golfer can only carry 14 clubs in his bag! - Count the clubs in Drabble's bag! - ...13...14...*15*! WHAT?? I demand a RECOUNT!! Oh, yeah...I FOUND
dr130819 -- one!
dr130820 -- Since Ralph has an extra club in his bag, we'll have to give him a 2-stroke penalty! - That means Steinbauer wins the tournament! YES! Hand over the trophy!! - I'll call my wife to share the news! You brought a CELL PHONE onto the course??
dr130820 -- That'll cost YOU 2 strokes! - WHAT?? The winner is Ralph Drabble again! WHAT??
dr130821 -- Drabble wins the tournament! You can't penalize me for having a cell phone!! - It's a course rule, Steinbauer! You should have known better! - Ohh, yeah? Well, let's just make a call! - * Hey, look who ELSE has one!
dr130822 -- *I* should be the winner! Ralph broke more golf rules than I did!! Did not! - He played with his shirt untucked! He hit the wrong ball! - He puts on his golf shoes in the parking lot! His caddy shielded him from the sun! - He wore CARGO
dr130822 -- PANTS! He wore his HAT inside the CLUBHOUSE!!
dr130823 -- After assessing penalties, the winner of the tournament is... - Let's see...add two...carry the one... - NO-NECK!! Really?? But I shot a *103*! Don't argue!
dr130824 -- - Be right back. - How come watching the food channel makes you want to eat, but watching the do-it-yourself network never makes you want to fix our leaky sink?
dr130825 -- putt! - FORE! - - - In all fairness, I did yell "fore"!
dr130826 -- I feel so much better now! - I get a little crabby when I'm hungry! - Oh, you do not! - Care for seconds?
dr130827 -- - - - - - The Dog Days of Summer can take a lot out of you!
dr130828 -- - - Wally, that's gross! Don't pull tissues out of the wastebasket! - Where do you LEARN such things? The Wiener Dog Academy offers post-graduate courses.

dr130904 -- ROWF ROWF ROWF ROWF! Wally, what's wrong with you? - What's wrong with ME? I'm trying to alert you all to the presence of danger! - There's a BADGER at the door, and I don't want him to get close to my loved ones! - ...or the dumb cat, for
dr130904 -- that matter! Awww!

dr130908 -- Slovenly? - Bumbling? Disheveled? Sub-par? Dumpy? Hungry? I was going to say "ambitious", but I'm going back to bed.
dr130909 -- You can relax, Wally. Animal control came and took away the badger! - They'll drive him to a remote location and release him into the wild. - You won't have to worry about him anymore! - I'll be back!
dr130910 -- Why is our calendar still in AUGUST? - Because the august picture is prettier than the September picture! - But how am I supposed to know what the date is?? It's easy... - Just remind yourself that whatever date it says, it's really 4 numbers
dr130910 -- higher! Why do I ask questions?
dr130911 -- There are a lot of shows you like on TV tonight, dad! It's OK, Patrick. I'll set the DVR! - Gas is really expensive! Don't worry. I'm car-pooling! - It might be a big waste of time! I wouldn't miss sit for the world, son! - OK, but please try
dr130911 -- not to embarrass me this year! The best thing about college is there's no back-to-school night!
dr130912 -- Home at last! - ? - Why do we have two welcome mats? Because this one's new, so I want you to wipe your feet on THAT one first!
dr130913 -- Uh-oh! Here comes the course marshal to tell us we need to play faster! - You need to pick up for the pace, gentlemen! Great golfers will not be rushed! And neither will WE!
dr130914 -- squeak squeak squeak squeak Not now, Wally. - ...Sigh... - NOW!! boot! - It's hard to teach patience to a wiener dog.

dr130923 -- Ralph, you've lost so much weight! You look great! Not only that, but I've saved enough money to put all our kids through college AND take a trip around the world! - That is NOT what would happen if I gave up ice cream! I'm just sayin'...
dr130924 -- ...so I said, "if you want me to shop at your store, you need better customer service!" - By the way, Kristine's birthday is tomorrow, so I'm baking her favorite cookies! - Speaking of cookies, have you tried those new cookies at Bulk Club's

dr140504 -- taste right! - Norm, there's a very simple solution to this problem! - Look! It's a sandwich! If you want the peanut butter to be on the bottom, all you have to do is hold it upside down! - Oh, yeah, huh! Why didn't *I* think of that? - Yeah,
dr140504 -- this works! ...Sigh...

dr140729 -- I think those seats are empty! I cant's see a thing in here! - How could someone be so clueless as to sit right in front of us? - That's your son and his date! I guess that explains the "clueless" part.

dr140815 -- the bleachers!
dr140816 -- I'm sorry I caught that ball in batting practice. It was rightfully yours! - I'm sure you'll catch one, too! It's the 8th inning. The game is almost over. - CRACK! Here comes another one!! - Oh, please catch it!

dr140930 -- ROWF ROWF ROWF! - ROWF ROWF ROWF ROWF! - ROWF ROWF ROWF ROWF This is why they don't allow dogs at tennis matches. It would be fun, though!

dr141207 -- I've got bread, now where's the peanut butter? Over on aisle 17! - ...Sigh...why is the bean on aisle 1, and the peanut butter on aisle 17? - Grocery stores should put things that naturally go together on the same aisle so we don't have to
dr141207 -- walk all over the store! - You mean like chips and dip? - Exactly! They should be right next to each other on the same aisle! - So should bread, peanut butter, chocolate chips, marshmallow cream, aerosol cheese, pork rinds and ketchup! Not

dr141227 -- fast?? I did most of the work over thanksgiving!
dr141228 -- I bought a few things at the grocery store today, honeybunch. - When I wheeled my shopping cart out to the car, I realized that I had neglected to pay for a tube of toothpaste. - So I took it back inside and paid for it! - The grocer couldn't
dr141228 -- believe it! He said most people aren't as honest as I am! - He said I was an inspiring individual, and if more people were like me, the world would be a better place! - Why did you buy toothpaste? - We have plenty of it under the sink! Why
dr141228 -- didn't you ask me before spending money on another tube?  Do you not like the toothpaste I buy? I hope yours was on sale! I'm going to talk to the guy at the grocery store some more!

dr150101 -- It's a new year, honeybunch! A new beginning! - A chance to improve ourselves and start doing things differently! - But you're starting this year like you've started all the others! I know. I was talking mostly about you.
dr150102 -- Come on, Wally! It's time for a bath! - AAARRGGH! - How about a WALK instead? - Happy dogs are much easier to pick up!
dr150103 -- Dang. - No clean bowls! - - Well, it seemed like a good idea for a few seconds!
dr150104 -- BURGERS Wow, this place is busy, dad! - Yeah, it seems to be everyone's favorite burger joint! - People hover over you while you're eating, hoping to get your table when you're done! - It drives me crazy! - Well, shall we... - ...stay a
dr150104 -- little longer? That was mean.
dr150105 -- zzyzxx - WHOA! - What's wrong, Ralph? I had a terrible nightmare! - I dreamed it was *2015* and I was really old! Go back to sleep. People your age need their rest!
dr150106 -- Aarrgh! Why are you sore, dad? - It's just an old hockey injury! - You played hockey? - Well, no... He slipped in the men's room at a Ducks game.
dr150107 -- How come basketball players high-five the guy who just missed a free throw? - Backing my day, it was embarrassing to miss a free throw! - Now everyone congratulates mediocrity! - Good point, dad! Am I right?
dr150108 -- - WOW! - Now I KNOW I'm getting old! - I never thought of Ethel Mertz as being a hottie before! At least you're not into AUNT BEE yet!
dr150109 -- HONK! - I seem to be getting honked at much more often! - I can't tell if I'm getting old, or if society is just getting more rude and impatient! - You're getting old. Yeah, you only go 10 m.p.h. over the speed limit!

dr150111 -- force yourself to say it, so you downgraded it to GOOD! - That's not true, honeybunch! Let me try again! - You look SENSATION..nice! You're going to be feeling fabulously in a minute!
dr150112 -- ** Beedle--dee-beetle-dee-bootle-dee-doo! ** - Everyone in the world should have their own ringtones!
dr150113 -- Brrrrr! It's FREEZING out there!! - I started a fire, dad! - Say "I BUILT a fired". When you say you say you STARTED a fire, it sounds like... - Be more careful next time! Sorry!

dr150115 -- I'll take your blood pressure now, Mr. Drabble. - shooka shooka shooka shooka shooka - BLAM! - Hee hee! That always makes the needle jump a little!
dr150116 -- Your X-ray concerns me, Mr. Drabble. - quite frankly, I've never seen anything like this! - Oh, wait a minute... - Never mind, it's upside-down! Never schedule a doctor's appointment for Friday afternoon!
dr150117 -- Honeybunch would kill me if she knew I got up for a midnight snack. - Hmm...we have three cartons of ice cream. - I'll have one spoonfull of each! That way, she won't notice I've gotten into them! - Too bad I can't think this clearly during
dr150117 -- the day!
dr150118 -- CARDS scratch scratch - Eenie, meenie, miney, moe! - Nope, too mushy! She'll know I didn't read it all! - I suppose I'd prefer this one! - Nope. Too funny. Not romantic enough. It IS cheaper, however! - I'd give her this one! No, THIS one!
dr150118 -- She'd like this one best! - ...Sigh... - My wife can't say I don't go to a lot of effort to pick out her anniversary card!
dr150119 -- ? - - Who used the dryer to make cotton candy?? It worked!!
dr150120 -- Hmm...I didn't know that! - You don't say! - That's fascinating! - You know you're in trouble when you're learning new things from your exam!
dr150121 -- I hate it when they give me a bath! - How come they never try to give YOU a bath? - Because cats are smarter than dogs and we can keep ourselves clean! - and also because if they ever try, we go like this!
dr150122 -- Please don't go! Poor Wally knows we're leaving him alone. - Want a treat, Wally? Yex! - CRUCH CRUNCH CRUNCH - Hey, that was the old "distraction" ploy!
dr150123 -- You're opening a WINDOW?? - It's COLD outside! Are you NUTS?? Nope! I'm perfectly sane! - Well, maybe not "perfectly." OK, let's see if I can kick it in from 30 yards!

dr150126 -- Remember the pain in my hip that I've been telling you about, Doc? - It's getting worse! I'll do ANYTHING to make it better! Just tell me what! - You need a hip replacement. - What did the doctor say? He said I just need to learn to live with
dr150126 -- it!
dr150127 -- The doctor said you need HIP SURGERY?? - Aren't you a little young for that?? It's not the years, it's the mileage! - I'm like a car that needs a little body work! - You could also use an air freshener! And some waxing. Sigh...
dr150128 -- The doctor said the only way to make my sore hip feel better is SURGERY! - Makes sense, dad! You've been complaining about the pain for months! I demand a second opinion!! - You need surgery, dummy! - There's your second opinion! I meant from
dr150128 -- someone who isn't my wife!!
dr150129 -- I refuse to have hip surgery, and that's final! - But the doctor says surgery will make your pain go away! I won't do it! - He says you'll feel like a new man! Absolutely not! - He says you'll be able to drive a golf ball significantly
dr150129 -- farther! Say what?
dr150130 -- The doctor sent you an application for a disabled parking permit. - You can use it while you recover from your surgery! Forget it. - I don't care HOW much pain I'll be in! There are people who need it more than I do! - I think there's a space
dr150130 -- in front of the donut shop. Where do I sign?
dr150131 -- Dad, don't get so stressed-out about having surgery! - But what if something goes wrong? The doctors know what they're doing! - Look on the bright side! By this time on Monday, it'll all be over! - Well, not OVER over! You know what I mean!
dr150131 -- Don't help me!
dr150201 -- Another Super Bowl Sunday in front of the TV! - - - - - Some people like the game, some people like commercials!
dr150202 -- St. Excruciation HOSPITAL It's time to wheel you to pre-op, Mr. Drabble. - In a little while, your surgery will be over and everything will be fine. - Don't worry about a thing, dear! kiss! ** Hop on the gurney, Mr. Drabble. - This is a
dr150202 -- gurney?? We've had a few cutbacks!
dr150203 -- St. Excruciation HOSPITAL Hi, doctor. Hello, Mr. Drabble! We'll be taking you to the O.R. shortly. - I sure hope I operate on the right body part today! - AH HA HA HA HA HA!! That wasn't funny. - He's cranky. Give him some happy juice! Yes,
dr150203 -- doctor. Happy juice?
dr150204 -- Hi, Ralph! Remember me? Nope! - I'm Linda! That's nice. - Linda? Who's Linda? I don't know any Lindas! - Ralph and I used to date! Oh, THAT Linda!!
dr150205 -- St. Excruciation HOSPITAL It's been a long time, hasn't it, Ralph? - Ralph and I used to date each other many years ago! - I remember now! I dated her right before I started dating honeybunch! - In fact, they may have overlapped a bit! I
dr150205 -- could tell some stories about you!
dr150206 -- What are the odds that my pre-op nurse would be my old girlfriend?? - I never told honeybunch all the details, but I was dating them at the SAME TIME! - And now, here they are in the same building as I'm about to have surgery! It's pretty
dr150206 -- funny! - I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE!! A little help in here please!
dr150207 -- So I heard you got married, Ralph. Is your wife here? Ubb...oobb..ubbub... - She's out in the waiting room! Wonderful! - While you're having your surgery, I'll go introduce myself! Time to go, Mr. Drabble! - NOOO!! Trust me, It'll all be over
dr150207 -- before you know it!
dr150208 -- - - - - HA! - HI! - HEEYA! - You'd think someone who's into martial arts would be able to kick a football farther! I think you were holding it too tight.
dr150209 -- I'm regaining consciousness. My surgery must be over! - I'm going to try to open my eyes now. - - Look who I just met, Ralph! I think I'll close them again!
dr150210 -- Look, Ralph! While you were in the operating room, I met your ex-girlfriend! - I never knew you were dating HER at the same time you were dating ME! - And *!* never knew why you stopped calling me! Why didn't you tell me you were getting
dr150210 -- married? - So, how did my surgery go? DON'T TRY TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT!
dr150211 -- HOSPITAL I can't believe my nurse is a girl I dated at the same time I was dating honeybunch! - Now they're BOTH mad at me! - How could things get any worse? - Time for your shots, loveboy! I asked your wife to help me!
dr150212 -- HOSPITAL Honeybunch, I can explain about Linda... - We only went out a few times, and the important thing is I married YOU, not HER!! - What are you talking about? Who's Linda? - The nurse I dated at the same time I was dating you! WHAT? I
dr150212 -- see the anesthesia is finally wearing off!
dr150213 -- HOSPITAL Everything looks good, Mr, Drabble! I expect a full and speedy recovery. You can go home tomorrow! - Your right hip will be good as new! You were supposed to operate on my LEFT hip!! - Ha ha! That was just a little more "doctor"
dr150213 -- humor! - There's a reason doctors become doctors and not comedians!
dr150214 -- Several Days Later.. Yawn! - Whoa! I forgot to use my walker! I just had surgery a week ago! - I guess I don't need it anymore! That's pretty neat! - Now I have another place to hang my clothes!
dr150215 -- Another missed free throw! I can't believe it! - There's no excuse for missing three free throws! You're only 15 feet away, everyone else has to stand still, and you can practice in your own driveway! - Free throws are IMPORTANT! Lots of games
dr150215 -- are decided by a point or two! - Back in MY day, when a guy missed a freethrow, he'd hang his head in shame and wait to be TRADED! - TODAY when you miss a free throw, you teammate's give you HIGH-FIVES! What's THAT all about?? - Would you
dr150215 -- high-five a GOLFER for missing a three-foot putt?! - I'm not even a basketball player and I practice my free throws!! I still might trade you!
dr150216 -- Wow, dad! - You're starting to look like your old self! - What does that mean? - You're getting gray and wrinkly!
dr150217 -- I like my new weather app! - It has a five.day forecast! - Tues * Wed * Thurs * Fri ** Sat - Saturday looks like a good day for sweatpants!

dr150220 -- I think it would be cool if basketball players were invisible! - All you'd see is the ball bouncing up and down! - Yeah, that would be sweet! - Most dads actually ENJOY watching sports with their sons! I also think it would be cool if hockey
dr150220 -- players were blindfolded!
dr150221 -- Hi, Wendy! - Seek closure, Norman! - Seek closure?? What on earth... - Oh! zip!
dr150222 -- Ralph, I told you to buy CRUSHED pineapple, not PINEAPPLE chunks! - No, you didn't! Yes, I did! - There's only one way to settle this: we'll do what the NBA does! - We'll ask a team of officials to watch the videotape! - The play is now under
dr150222 -- review! - - Oh, thank you. - Well? - Your ball. I kind of like this added feature of home surveillance system!

dr150224 -- #136: take smaller bites. - huh? What are you doing? - I'm making you a list of new year's resolutions for next year! - You're already up to *136*?? It's only FEBRUARY!! Darn! My pen ran out of ink!

dr150226 -- Hello? Oh, hi, honeybunch! ...where am I? - I'm just taking the dog for a walk! Wow, his leash is shorter than mine!
dr150227 -- Sweet! No line! - I'll be right with you! - ? - Even when there's no line, the wait time is often the same!
dr150228 -- Patrick, guess what! - I went to the hockey game, and they put me up on the giant video screen! - Did they put you on the DANCE-cam or the KISS-cam? - The MESSY-EATER-cam!
dr150301 -- I love reading the newspaper! - I like the smell of ink! I like how it feels in my hands! - I love the sports section, the entertainment section...I do the crossword puzzle and save the comics for last! - Reading the paper is the most
dr150301 -- enjoyable part of my day! - I feel sorry for his generation!
dr150302 -- Daddy, can we build a pool? - Sorry, Penny. I can't afford it! Just get more money! - Do you think money comes from trees? Of course not! - It comes from under the couch cushions!
dr150303 -- Echo, this is my pet duck, Bob. - My dad hates ducks, so I told him Bob was a rare South American parrot! - I told MY dad that MY pet was a TOUCAN! - I can't believe how different we are!
dr150304 -- I'd like a guacamole burger, hold the guacamole. - Add bacon and cheese, with curly fries! That's exactly what I was going to order! - Only I'll have regular fries instead of curly fries! - What's happening to us? We used to have so much in
dr150304 -- common!
dr150305 -- It's amazing how much we have in common, Norman! - Excuse me, Echo, but I like to sit on the aisle! - I like to sit on the aisle, too! - Sometimes it can be a curse to have so much in common!
dr150306 -- Say cheese! - Penny, don't squint when you smile for a picture! Open your eyes wider! - Let's try again! Say cheese! - Not quite the improvement I was hoping for!
dr150307 -- - Perfect! - One donut weighs the same as three cookies! - I like to eat a balanced diet!
dr150308 -- WALLY zzyzx - - - - - z - - munch munch! YUK! - Apparently, a honey-mustard potato chip falling on the floor sounds exactly like a regular potato chip falling on the floor!
dr150309 -- Eat your carrots, Penny! Your body LIKES carrots! - My mouth is part of my body, and my mouth doesn't like 'em! - WA HA HA! - I mean, eat your carrots, young lady!
dr150310 -- I'm sorry, sir. You can't bring your drink into the theater! - But it costs a fortune to buy one inside! You'll have to throw it away. - OK, fine. - I thought you threw that away! I threw away the decoy!
dr150311 -- What a wonderful picture of you, Norman. You look so happy. - You remind me of your great-uncle Harold, shortly before he lost everything in the depression. - I'm so sad how he met his untimely end in the Pioneer Day parade. - I wish grandma
dr150311 -- wouldn't leave comments on my Instagram photos!

dr150315 -- on it for months! - You have? Follow me! - VOILA! - And remember, we haven't even looked under the car seats yet! The crud between the sofa cushions is NOT food storage!
dr150316 -- St. Patrick's Day used to be my favorite holiday... - A celebration of my Irish heritage! - Then my wife researched my ancestry and discovered I'm not Irish. - Now it's just not the same! Kiss me. I used to be Irish! If it makes you feel any
dr150316 -- better, your 3rd cousin 5 times removed owned an Irish setter!
dr150317 -- I used to love St. Patrick's day! I'd dress all in green and wear a funny hat! - But then you had to go research my ancestry! - Now I can't enjoy St. Paddy's Day anymore because I'm not Irish! Oh, well... - You can still enjoy Fat Tuesday!
dr150318 -- Here's our dinner, Ralph. - Salad, carrot sticks, celery... - And a rice cake for dessert! - Is it safe to assume you ate cookie dough for lunch again? That would be very UN-safe!
dr150319 -- May I have a cookie, honeybunch? Of course you can have a cookie! You're a grown man! - Can I play golf on Saturday? - Stop asking me for permission to do things. It drives me crazy! - Allow me to apologize!

dr150518 -- Echo! Norman! What are YOU doing here?? SNO-CONES - I got a summer job here at the sno-cone snack! Me too! - We think so much alike, it's amazing! - It's hard to believe this is a two-man job, though! You're standing on both of my feet!
dr150519 -- Here you go! Thanks! - See? Perfect! I did the ice and you did the flavors! - That's why this is a two-person job! - Wait, who was supposed to take the money? Oh, great. Now it's a THREE-PERSON job!
dr150520 -- I can't believe we got jobs in the same sno-cone stand! - Maybe we can own our own sno-cone stand some day! - Between your brains and my brains, we could be a huge success! - Maybe. Hello! Is anyone in there?!
dr150521 -- Norman! We have a problem! I can't shut off the sno-cone machine! - There's ice EVERYWHERE!! - That explains why it*s getting so cold in here! - I wondered why my lips were turning blue!
dr150522 -- I can't turn off the ice machine!! It's piling up fast!! We need to get out of here, Echo!! - What are we going to do?? Don't panic! I just need to use my common sense! - I know! First we'll close this window to keep the heat inside!
dr150523 -- Echo, I just texted my dad and explained that we're trapped inside the sno-cone shack! - I told him it's filling up with snow because the machine won't turn off! I asked him what to do! chirp chirp! - Dad Unplug it, you moron! - What did he
dr150523 -- say? He said we should snuggle together until help arrives!

dr150524 -- that's not how the screen is always supposed to look? No! Where's your remote? We don't know how to work it! I love grandma and grandad, but sometimes I wonder how they ever made it into their eighties.
dr150525 -- Dad! Thank heavens you're here! - We unplugged the ice machine, but we still can't get out! - The snow is piled so high against the door we can't pull it open! I don't know how much longer we can... - Oh. The sno-cone shack. That's a simple
dr150525 -- job, I thought...
dr150526 -- I HEAR IT!! - It's coming! It's coming!! - Oh, please stop here!! Mom sure gets excited when she hears the *UPS* van! It's the adult equivalent of the ice cream truck!

dr150531 -- What are you doing, Ralph? Writing a note to myself, No-Neck! - On your HAND?? you don't have to do that! You can write reminders to yourself on your phone! I can? How?? - Just open the "Notes" icon. A blank page appears with a keyboard
dr150531 -- underneath. Type your message and save it! - Now all you have to do is check "Notes" and you'll be able to see what you wrote to yourself! That's kinda neat! - But I'm still confused...about something... - How will I remember to check my
dr150531 -- notes? Easy! Tie a string around your finger!
dr150601 -- Ralph, will you please feed Wally? - Yeah, sure. - I LOVE it when HE makes my dinner! - He makes it like he makes his ice cream! There! That looks about right to me!
dr150602 -- Norman posted a new tweet! - Norman Drabble If I could go back in time and do something... - I'd probably go and save Mufasa in the Lion king. That scene was messed up. - Would it be wrong to unfollow my own son?
dr150603 -- Be careful, dad! - There are signs on this beach warning that sharks have been sighted! - Aw, I'm not worried! - On second thought, let's all move back a little!

dr150605 -- We're having a drought, you know... - Is it really a good idea to use up our water to fill a pool? Probably not. - That's why I'm using Mr. Steinbauer's water. HEY!

dr150613 -- SLAM! - Anything wrong, honeybunch? - Either I'm in really bad mood, or everyone at the mall is stupid! - Please let everyone at the mall be stupid.
dr150614 -- Self-Service YOGURT I like this yogurt shop, honeybunch! - They give you taster cups to sample the flavors! - - - trash - - - trash - I'm sure they'd give you more taster cups if you ask nicely! It's OK. It gets all over my hands anyway!
dr150615 -- I can't remember how it's supposed to go... - Does the paper hang over or under? - Who cares? Even if I get it wrong, what's the worst that could happen? - All right, who put on the new roll?
dr150616 -- I envy people who sit in the front row at baseball games. - They can see the break of a curveball, the the sweat on a player's brow... - and apparently, the cell reception's not bad, either!
dr150617 -- Our DVR is 97% full. - If we record another show, we'll lose one that we've already recorded! - Honeybunch, you need to stop recording that dumb cooking show that you never watch! - It might cause me to lose an episode of that car restoration

dr150621 -- "You may not be the smartest dad in the world, or the most handsome... - "You may not be a hero or a superstar or even particularly important... - "You may not be wealthy or have a cool job... - "You may not be the snappiest dresser... - "And
dr150621 -- you may not have the best head of hair... - Don't you love it when the kids make their own father's day cards? I just hope there's a "but" coming up pretty soon! "Youmay not be our first choice to help us with our homework...
dr150622 -- WHIRRR - I love my new vacuum! - I mean, YOUR no vacuum! - Why did you even ask me for father's day gift ideas?

dr150628 -- WALLY! - DID YOU GET INTO THE KITCHEN TRASH? No. - BAD DOG! Don't yell at me! I didn't do it! - Why does the dog always get blamed for everything? - Any time something goes wrong around the house, everyone assumes it's the dog's fault! - I'm
dr150628 -- just a convenient fall guy! It's not fair and I won't stand for it anymore! - AND YOU ALSO GOT INTO THE *BATHROOM* TRASH?!! OK, THAT was me!

dr150713 -- How was your doctor appointment, honeybunch? Not good - sniff! What's wrong?? - My doctor wasn't as nice as he usually is. He acted like he barely knew me! - But...is everything ELSE OK? Physically I'm fine, but emotionally I'm scarred!
dr150714 -- I've been going to Dr. Green for years. - He's always been nice and friendly. He's always taken an interest in my stories... - But today he couldn't be bothered! It's like I was a stranger! - WHAT'S HAPPENING TO US? Maybe you two should
dr150714 -- consider counseling!
dr150715 -- Ralph, you just don't understand...my doctor is an important person to me! - Today he seemed cold and indifferent! - I worry that I may have offended him somehow! - Maybe I'll send flowers to his office! Did he happen to run any mental tests
dr150715 -- on you?
dr150716 -- Honeybunch, it's not unusual to think of your doctor as sort of a second husband. - You spend a lot of time with him, and he knows a lot about you! - It's kind of like how I think of the girl at the yogurt shop as...as... - WHOA! MY APPENDIX!
dr150716 -- CALL AN AMBULANCE! Nice try. Please finish your thought.
dr150717 -- It's useless trying to lose weight! - I'm just naturally husky! - It's obviously in my genes! - My genes must be "relaxed fit".
dr150718 -- Rowf rowf rowf rowf rowf Wally! No barking! - rowf rowf rowf rowf rowf rowf rowf rowf rowf rowf - Wally! I said NO BARKING! - What part of "no barking" do you not understand? The "no" and the "barking".

dr150720 -- This is amazing... - The queen is going to renovate Buckingham Palace. - It's going to cost three-quarters of a billion dollars! Wow! - She must be using the same guy who did our kitchen!

dr150728 -- face is similar to my "oh boy, I can have ice cream for breakfast" face!
dr150729 -- Don't look so sad! I'll only be gone for a few days! - I'm going to go back and give them another hug! - SPLASH! NO WATER BALLOONS INDOORS!!
dr150730 -- Do you think mom will be mad that you took us for fast food? No... - While she's away, we still have to eat! - I'm not a good cook. She'll understand! - Do you think she'll be mad that you took us at midnight? Everyone enjoys a late night
dr150730 -- snack!
dr150731 -- chirp chirp! Uh-oh! Your mom just texted! - She said "I'm almost home". - text text text How almost home are you? Ask her to drive around the block a few times while I get the vacuum!
dr150801 -- Yes, I had such a good time, too! I can't believe she's talking to her friends again! - She just spent three days with them, and she STILL has things to talk about?? How is that POSSIBLE? - I've got nothing to talk to my brother about because
dr150801 -- I just talked to him last Christmas!
dr150802 -- I'm going to be late for my tee-time! - whimmer... What? You need to go out? - All right, but make it snappy! - I don't have time for you to SUNBATHE!! - I can't leave you out there! You're just gonna wanna come back inside in five minutes! -
dr150802 -- Fine! I'll leave you! Goodbye! - whimmer Oh, for... - What now? Something to eat? OK. - ...and after that, he wanted to play Frisbee. I'm glad you could join me for the back nine!
dr150803 -- I haven't seen Wendy a while. There's her house. I wonder if she misses me? - There's only one way to find out. - Yes? I'm Not With Stupid Anymore Never mind!
dr150804 -- PIZZA You know, Ralph, I really didn't think I was going to like the pizza you ordered... - And I was right. The Donut Pizza is an acquired taste!
dr150805 -- You kids drive me crazy! - It's summer! Go OUTSIDE and play! - Whoa! The glare is terrible! - Not as bad as the glare INSIDE!
dr150806 -- There's your ball! I can't believe I hooked it way out here! - It's kind of scenic, though! - Fortunately I have just the right stick for this situation! - 
dr150807 -- Knock knock! Who's there? - Banana! Banana who? - Um...don't cry! It's just a joke! - HA HA HA HA! She definitely inherited your sense of humor!
dr150808 -- I'll teach you how that joke really goes, Penny... - Knock, knock! Who's there? - Boo! EEK! - Mommy! Daddy's trying to scare me! Maybe comedy's not her thing!
dr150809 -- - - - - - The kiss-cam is striking out tonight! Say what?
dr150810 -- I'll have a Chocolate Long John! And for you, Ralph? - I'll have one "Ralph Drabble". - How did you get a donut named after you, dad? - It all started when your mom said I could only buy one donut per week!
dr150811 -- BOP - BOP BLAM! - Nothing like a rousing game of bop-bop-blam! I always win!
dr150812 -- Did I snore last night? - Maybe a little. That's so embarrassing. - No need to be embarrassed. - The guy across the street assumed it was me. THE GUY ACROSS THE STREET??
dr150813 -- - - I'm back from the snack bar. What took you so long? - It takes a while to fill one of their large drink cups!
dr150814 -- Good morning, Chester! How's it going? Not so good, Ralph. - You know how a balloon is always drawn with a little rectangle there to make it look shiny? - I'm having trouble making it look right! Gee, that's too bad. - Nobody really cares
dr150814 -- about the problems of a cartoonist!
dr150815 -- Ralph, I think you should start going to the gym. - I DO go to the gym! you do? How often? - Every day. - Maybe you should start doing different exercises. - Or go to a gym that isn't next to a donut shop!

dr150817 -- HOLD STILL! I'LL GET HIM! - That's my pet parrot, you fenderhead!! No one understands my sense of humor!
dr150818 -- twist twist spin spin! - Voila! - Just for you, Ralph! They keep my favorite donut in there in case they run out before I get here!
dr150819 -- - DANG! - I hate it when I beat myself at Tic-Tac-Toe! - Although part of me liked it! I'll sure be glad when school starts again!
dr150820 -- Whoa! That driver just cut me off! - Why would someone DO something like that?! - Probably because you were driving so slow! - And why does my wife always take the other guy's side? And also because your car is so dirty!
dr150821 -- Why should I act happy if I don't FEEL happy? - It's hypocritical! It's not real! slap slap - I refuse to pretend to be something I'm not. - ...said Norman, as he put on hairspray and cologne!
dr150822 -- ka-pok! ka-pok! ka-pok! ka-pok! - CRUNCH! Problem solved! Do we have any more ping pong balls?

dr150823 -- interesting group! chirp chirp!
dr150824 -- DONUTS Bad news, Ralph! I can't save your favorite donuts for you anymore. - "Donut-Saving" is a violation of the International Donut Shop Owner's Agreement. - It's first come, first served. You'll just have to get here a little earlier! -
dr150824 -- What's the world coming to? Can I interest you in these plain ones nobody wants?
dr150825 -- Steinbauer! You beat me to the donut shop this morning! - I want all of your remaining chocolate long johns! - WHAT? you can't buy them all! Those are my favorite! You only want them all to SPITE me! - Mmm...delicious! THIS MEANS WAR!!
dr150826 -- Ralph! You beat me to the donut shop this morning! - Please tell me you're not buying up all the donut holes! Those are my favorite!! - Ralph! Answer me!! - Thay wha?
dr150827 -- Steinbauer won't beat me to the donut shop this morning! - He won't be able to pick all the ones I wanted! I'll be the first in line when it opens! - Come on in, Ralph! - Thanks for letting me sleep in here, Timmy!
dr150828 -- I hate parking garages. Finally I see a spot on level five! - Don't forget to lock the doors. OK - BEEP! - That's another reason I hate parking garages!
dr150829 -- I hate underground parking garages! - You drive around and around until you find a level with empty spaces... - Then you have to go up a bunch of escalators. - And one of them is always broken. Please use the stairs
dr150830 -- - - - ...Sigh... - What's the date? - August 30th. - Hmm... - Eh, why bother? If you procrastinate long enough, you can get away with never taking down your Christmas lights!
dr150831 -- Don't even THINK about it, you dumb cat! I won't. - BLAM! - That was a no-brainer! This is why it's not called the CAT days of summer!
dr150901 -- It's September! How can it already be September?? - What happened to AUGUST?? What happened to *2015*?? - Where did the time go?? Where did my LIFE go??! - Time for another "first of the month" speech! It's better than his "high price of gas"
dr150901 -- speech!
dr150902 -- Ooooh! - I can't understand why I have such a bellyache! - I've only eaten two things today... - A box of donuts and a bucket of chicken! Go figure.
dr150903 -- Honeybunch, what are you cooking? - I was outside and noticed something smells really good! - Spinach souffle! - Maybe it was the neighbors.
dr150904 -- The freezer door won't close! - You've got to use a little finesse, Ralph! - SHOVE! - Voila!
dr150905 -- Ice cream, cookies, candy, donuts... - Diet powder. - HA HA! - Sorry. I'm not supposed to laugh! Never put the diet powder at the end of the conveyor belt!
dr150906 -- OK, smile for daddy! - Excuse me...would you like me to take the picture so you can be in it, too? - Yes! Thank you! - OK, one...two... Excuse me! - Would you like to be in the picture, too? - Say cheese!
dr150907 -- Whoa! Here comes Dad again! Look out!! - - SPLOOSHT1 - It's a good thing the pool is so close to the barbecue!
dr150908 -- Goodbye, summer! - I can always feel a change after labor day! - Outside, fall is in the air! - Inside, winter is in the air! Fa la la lala...
dr150909 -- Fall is in the air! - I've heard that cartoonists hate autumn. Why? - Because falling leaves are hard to draw. - Snow is easier! Guess it's going to be a short autumn!
dr150910 -- It's true... - Snow is much easier for a cartoonist to draw than falling leaves. - Although drawing a bunch of little circles can make your hand cramp up. - NOW we're talking!
dr150911 -- What are you watching? "Sharknado". - Well, I'm glad you're instilling on our kids an appreciation for the cinematic masterpieces! - Maybe later you can broaden their horizons with The Three Stooges! - That was a little SNARKnado!
dr150912 -- Men - ? - WHIRRRRR - Some of those automatic handdryers are very powerful!
dr150913 -- Thank you! Thank you! - I LOVE getting packages! I'm so excited! I'm like a kid on Christmas!! - It's taped up pretty good! How am I going to get it open?? - Darn! My car keys don't work! - Give me your comb! His comb?? - THIS WON'T OPEN IT,
dr150913 -- EITHER! - Should we get scissors? Not yet, I'm wondering what she'll try next! Stick out your claw, Oogie! We never acted like this on Christmas!
dr150914 -- I predict this batter will hit a home run! - Or maybe a triple, double or single... - Or he'll walk make an out, or reach base on an error or a dropped third strike! - YES! I CALLED IT! You've got quite a feel for the game, son!
dr150915 -- Trash day was yesterday, Steinbauer! - You need to put away your cans in a more timely manner! - I'll put my cans away when you put away your St. Patrick's Day flag! - Oh, yeah! It's on my to-do list!
dr150916 -- Why does Wally always follow you around, mom? - Because he thinks I'm the leader of the pack! - When I'm not here, he follows your dad because he's next in line! You're next in line after that! - He's never followed me anywhere! I figure at
dr150916 -- that point, I'm better off on my own!
dr150917 -- Whenever I make a note to myself, I can't decipher my own handwriting! - So my family convinced me to make notes on my cell phone instead. - Hammocks not fat. It's not off it's ouch. - That's not working out so great, either!
dr150918 -- ICE CREAM I can't believe how much we have in common, Echo! - Just remember, no two snowflakes are exactly alike! What's that supposed to mean? - It means things that seem alike might actually be very different! - I know what that means, but
dr150918 -- what is that SUPPOSED to mean??!
dr150919 -- Norman, I'm just saying... - Sometimes things that seem similar are actually very different! - No two snowflakes are exactly alike! - I used to think the expression was "no two CONFLAKES..." Me too! And I'd stare at them all at breakfast! Me
dr150919 -- too!
dr150920 -- I'm going to look ridiculous at my army reunion! What's wrong, Ralph? - I can barely fit into my uniform anymore! I haven't gained THAT much weight! Why won't it fit me?? - Well, for one thing, that's Norman's boy scout uniform! Oh, thank
dr150920 -- heavens!
dr150921 -- Hey, it's a foul ball! I might be able to catch it!! - Here, catch it with your jacket! - What??! Don't use your bare hands, use your jacket! - How on earth can you catch a BASEBALL with a JACKET??! DO I need to demonstrate? Honestly, you're
dr150921 -- so clueless!
dr150922 -- I GIT IT! I GOT IT!! Ralph, you can't catch it with your bare hands! - You'll break a finger! Here, use your jacket! - What are you talking about?? I've never seen anyone catch a ball with a JACKET! - Fine. Do it your way! I saw a guy catch
dr150922 -- one in his hat once. This must be a really high foul ball!
dr150923 -- I GOT IT! Ralph, I'm telling you, catch it with your jacket! - All right! All right! - WHAP! * * - Ouch. Well, you weren't supposed to hold it THAT way!
dr150924 -- I SEE IT! Where? Over there! - That's it! That's it!! - I spend a fortune to take my family to a major league baseball game, and what excites them? Seeing our car in the parking lot! Let me see! Let me see!
dr150925 -- Trash - Cans & Bottles - Yard Trimmings Donut Boxes

dr150928 -- Hmmm... - How many stamps does it take to mail a letter to Idaho? - How should I know? - People our age don't mail letters! I'm going to guess eleven.
dr150929 -- Are you Ralph Drabble? Yes. - Are you all right? Yes, why? - We were asked to do a wellness check. You were reported missing. Who reported me missing? - Timmy's Donut Shop, Dave's Pizza, and Yogurt City. I guess I forgot to tell them I was
dr150929 -- going on a diet!
dr150930 -- Two sodas, $2 each... - That'll be $4! The sign outside reads "Buy One, Get One". - Right! You get one if you buy it!
dr151001 -- It's not fair... - Women have to be thin and attractive. - And men don't have to be anything! - I guess I'm living proof of that!
dr150102 -- squeak squeak squeak - Ralph, it's so embarrassing to walk through the library with you! squeak squeak squeak - Take off those squeaky shoes! ...Sigh... OK - squeak squeak squeak Maybe I need a chiropractor!
dr151003 -- Remember to pick up your toys, Penny! Why? - Because we want our home to be neat and tidy! Why? - Because mommy doesn't like clutter! Why? - Why do you keep asking why? Why not?
dr151004 -- Where's Penny? - I can't find her anywhere?  Hee hee! - Where could she be? chuckle chuckle I think she's under the blanket! - I've looked all over the house! Here she is! Hey! - Maybe she's under the couch! She's right here! Trust me! I know
dr151004 -- how to find people! - Maybe she's under the table! I'm that bump under the blanket, daddy! I give up! I love my family, but some of them aren't very bright! Do what cats do...just ignore them!
dr151005 -- I check my blood pressure every time I see one of these testing machines. - Whoa! It's a little high! - Maybe the waiting room of the car mechanic isn't the best place for this. It's going to cost an additional $600!
dr151006 -- Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter... - Kids today spend hours and hours staring at phones and computers! - I feel sorry for them! - Think of all the TV shows they're missing!
dr151007 -- Dinner! - - - Now for dessert!
dr151008 -- Can we buy a pumpkin here? No! We could go to the supermarket and buy FIVE pumpkins for the price of one of these! - You and your big mouth! I didn't mean it literally!
dr151009 -- I'm going to watch the ballgame with the volume down, and listen to Vin Scully call the game on radio! - Why? Because Vin is the best baseball announcer ever! - The only problem is, we'll hear it on radio five seconds before we see it on TV!
dr151009 -- - Wow, he must REALLY be good! I can't figure out how he does it!
dr151010 -- Jefferson, Adams, Washington, Franklin... - It's amazing that such talent was all in the same place at the same time! Yup! - I can only remember that happening one other time in history... - It was when Scully, Enberg, Miller and Chickie-Baby
dr151010 -- all did play-by-play in L.A.!
dr151011 -- It must be October! - The rake is getting a workout! - I've raked the front yard and the backyard... - But I'm still not done! - Hey! Thanks for dropping all your candy wrappers in a pile, dad! Just trying to be helpful, son!
dr151012 -- BOOT! - -Out! - CALL FOR A VIDEO REPLAY!! It's just intramural kickball, Ralph!
dr151013 -- We seem to be the only parents who come to watch the intramural kickball games. - I always hope for some reason to cheer for Norman! - He's GOT to be able to succeed at kickball! - KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE BALL AND TIE YOUR SHOES!
dr151014 -- BLOOT! - I got it! I got it! - OUT! - That ball is not properly inflated! I'm calling the commissioner! I doubt there's a commissioner of intramural kickball!
dr151015 -- How was school, Penny? Terrible. - I only got TWO STARS on my snowman! - TWO Stars?? Not FOUR?? I spent hours working on... - I mean, I spent hours watching you work on this all by yourself!
dr151016 -- I'm home from school! How was your day? - Boring! I only had three exams to take! - There are no exams tomorrow, so I have nothing to study for tonight! - I can't WAIT until I'm in law school! Maybe you can read "War and Peace" again tonight!
dr151017 -- How was your day, Norman? - Pretty good, mom! - I forgot it was Saturday and there's no school, so I got to come home early! - That's YOUR son! I wondered how I found such a sweet parking spot!
dr151018 -- chirp chirp chirp chirp chirp chirp! - May - chirp chirp chirp chirp chirp chirp - I - chirp chirp chirp chirp chirp chirp - Have - chirp chirp chirp chirp chirp chirp ...Sigh... - Dessert - Hee hee chirp chirp chirp chirp chirp chirp Patrick,
dr151018 -- why are you texting me one word at a time? Have I ever mentioned that mom's text alerts drive me crazy Yes, and you probably shouldn't have!
dr151019 -- - - - That was the lamest corn maze I've ever seen! No refunds.
dr151020 -- Don't feel bad, Patrick... - Every soccer goalie knows what it's like to give up the winning goal. - And no one ever feels worse then the goalie! - Except maybe the goalie's dad! Sniff!
dr151021 -- You always THINK you know what I'm trying to say, but you usually don't. - I'm amazed at how often you're wrong! - You mean well, but quite frankly, you're just annoying! - So, what did you learn today? That I'm the human equivalent of
dr151021 -- auto-correct!
dr151022 -- There's nothing more fun than a college football game, Stu! - The cheerleaders, the marching band...what's not to like? - We could use a better mascot! What have you got against roly-poly bugs?
dr151023 -- Who ever heard of having a roly-poly bug as a college mascot?? - Roly-poly bugs are very important to our ecological balance! - But it's a terrible mascot!! It's stupid and embarrassing and... - They also rollup into a ball when they feel
dr151023 -- threatened!
dr151024 -- I love the atmosphere at college football games, Stu! - The student section is over there, the alumni section's there. - Wait, how come WE don't sit in the student section? - We sit in the nerd section. Excuse me, where did you buy that
dr151024 -- "Star Wars" pocket protector?
dr151025 -- PUMPKIN FARM Rides! Games! Animals! - - - - - - Hello, 911?
dr151026 -- I seem to be a little congested, mom. I probably should stay home from school tomorrow! Nice try, Patrick. - Now clean up the pumpkin guts!
dr151027 -- Once again, I have the best jack-o'-lantern in the neighborhood! Take a look at min, Steinbauer! - I call it a jerk-o'-lantern!
dr151028 -- - - KWAK - Quack-o'-lantern!
dr151029 -- Careful! It might be a prank! Yeah! That might be a GUY wearing a DUMMY costume! - And he'll probably jump out at us when we reach for candy! Naah! That's just a dummy! - He might be real! It's hard to tell! If he's real, that's sure a good
dr151029 -- DUMMY costume! ...Sigh...
dr151030 -- Trick or treat! Great costume! - Thank you! What's that supposed to be? You dad's exercise bike!
dr151031 -- Hey, you're the college mascot! The roly-poly bug! - You're too big for trick-or-treating! - Go away! - He's such a sensitive type!
dr151101 -- SALE Women's Apparel - - - - - - ...Sigh... - When the escalator is broken, you can just walk up the steps, you know! I decided I'd just rather stand here than go up to women's apparel.
dr151102 -- $200,000,000??!! Maybe I should by one! - Don't so it, Ralph! Gambling rarely pays off! - $200,000,000??! You'd be crazy not to buy a $2 ticket! - Wait, it only costs two bucks?? Buy a thousand tickets and increase your chances!
dr151103 -- What if I won the lottery?? Just think how my life would change! - Don't do it! Most lottery winners die penniless! - He's probably going to die penniless anyway, so what's the difference? Let me get back to you on that!
dr151104 -- - Oh no! The winning lottery ticket was sold at the Polecat Mini-Mart! - That's where I ALMOST bought a ticket!... - But someone talked me out of it! Sorry! That's the ONE TIME you didn't listen to me!
dr151105 -- I can't believe it! I almost bought a lotto ticket at the Mini-Mart. - And THAT'S where the winning ticket was sold! - What could be worse than knowing I could've been a millionaire?? - "The winner is GEORGE STEINBAUER"?? Good morning, poor
dr151105 -- person!
dr151106 -- I can't believe you won the lottery, Steinbauer! - How will you ever spend two hundred million bucks? Trust me. I'm a shrewd businessman! - Besides, half of the money is already gone. Taxes? - No, I stopped by the casino on the way home!
dr151107 -- Think of all the good you can do with your lottery money! I've already done it! - I sent the rest of my money to the widow of a benevolent dictator, who sent me an E-Mail begging for financial assistance! - That's a scam. It IS?? - THANK
dr151107 -- goodness I used my credit card! At least I'll get 3% cash back!

dr151109 -- haunt us! It's true, mom. Dad's not crazy! Well...
dr151110 -- If you can't throw away the abominable pumpkin man, what should we DO with him? - If you leave him alone until thanksgiving, he disappears. If you throw him away, he comes back to haunt you! - That's the worst preposterous thing you've ever
dr151110 -- said... - Besides "I'm going to lose ten pounds." I'm still working on that!!

dr151216 -- So, what do you think will happen in episode 7? I think Jar Jar Binks will emerge as the Evil Mastermind! I think it will be revealed that Yoda and Miss Piggy are brother and sister! - Why did episodes 4,5, and 6 come before 1, 2, and 3?
dr151216 -- Perfect sense to me it makes! I think Kylo Ren is really...I can't even SAY it!! Can't we all talk about something else besides STAR WARS??
dr151217 -- Camping out for this movie was a dumb idea, Echo! - I haven't slept in three days, and some of these other "Star Wars" fans are weird! - How am I ever going to make it until midnight?? - The force you must use! OH, SHUT UP!

dr160103 -- environmentally friendly. - But mascots are supposed to be tough and intimidating! Yeah, but... - I have to admit, it IS kind of fun to watch him roll up into a ball when he feels threatened!

dr160107 -- Trust me, they won't tell Perry Como!
dr160108 -- You're just perfect, Echo! - You're totally awesome! - You're everything a guy would ever want! - I sure hope *I* meet a girl like you some day!

dr160117 -- I HATE COMPUTERS!! - Dad, relax! Computers should not be intimidating! - The trouble with your generation is that you're afraid to do anything when you encounter a problem! - You're scared you're going to touch the wrong button and wreck
dr160117 -- everything! - People my age know that's virtually impossible! - Look, all you have to do is this... - PFFFSSCHTT!! - OK, you may need to call tech support.
dr160118 -- Dad, why do you always stare into the fridge for such a long time? - I'm like a bird of prey, patiently studying the area with a keen eye until... - Suddenly I SWOOP DOWN and snatch exactly what I want! - Gotcha! That poor can of cake

dr160124 -- Hey, we're locked out! - Your mom must have gone somewhere with Penny and Patrick! - Do you have a key, Norm? No, but I know where we can find one! - I bought one of those fake rocks for hiding keys inside! Good thinking! - Here it is! Great!
dr160124 -- - But wait...please tell me you put a KEY inside it! - Don't worry. I'm not THAT stupid! - It doesn't work! - That's because I put the wrong key inside in case a burglar finds the fake rock! ...Sigh...
dr160125 -- Sweet! I found some Halloween candy corn between the sofa cushions! - THREE MONTH RULE!! Dogs are disgusting!
dr160126 -- Wally! You bad dog! - He ate some old Halloween candy he found between the sofa cushions! - The candy's only three months old. He's a dog. He'll be OK! - Yeah, but *I* wanted to eat it!

dr160131 -- - What are you doing? - I figured as long as I'm bending over, I might as well tee up another ball. Why? - If the first ball goes in the lake, then I won't have to bend over again! - But if your first ball lands on the farway, you'll have to
dr160131 -- bend over again to pick up the second ball! - Good point. Let's see what happens. - THWAK! - SPLOINK! YES! For that matter, maybe you should've teed up 5 or 6!
dr160201 -- Patrick, will you please hover the dog? - OK! Hover the dog?? - It's easier than getting him to WALK the dog!
dr160202 -- Every new year's, dad starts a diet. - And on groundhog day, he checks the results. I can't see the numbers. That means six more weeks of dieting!
dr160203 -- Hi, Wendy! - How do you like my hoverboard? - Pretty impressive, eh? - It would be more so without the training wheels!
dr160204 -- You're going too slow! I look forward to the day we have driverless cars! - Turn here! I look forward to the day we have backseat driverless cars!

dr160209 -- THINK OF FOOD??
dr160210 -- It's so hard to decide on a paint color! - I bought some samples and put them on the wall! What do you think? - I think it's a brilliant idea! - Keep painting and see if you can cover the room!
dr160211 -- After looking at hundreds of paint chips... - And buying 31 different paint samples... - I have finally decided on a color for our living room. - Beige! Now now...let's not get TOO adventurous!
dr160212 -- - I've changed my mind. Let's go with the "pigeon gray."
dr160213 -- Isn't it amazing, Ralph? By just repainting, we changed the whole look of our living room quickly and cheaply! - Of course, now that the color is different, we'll have to buy a new couch, new drapes, new carpet, new artwork...

dr160215 -- ? - Hypnosis - MOO! - PATRICK!!
dr160216 -- Patrick, did you hypnotize Norman into thinking he's a cow? Yes. MOO! - Why? It was my science project. - He's eating grass! That's actually good because our lawn mower is broken. - OK, but promise to snap him out of it in a couple of hours!
dr160216 -- Will do!
dr160217 -- When I snap my fingers, you will wake up and think you're a wiener dog! - SNAP! Now THAT'S pretty impressive! I've never been so insulted!
dr160218 -- You should run for class president, Norm! - Me?? Why would you suggest that? What leadership qualities do *I* have?? Where do I begin? - You're honest, you're nice, you're...you're... - I could go on and on! I was at least hoping you'd get up
dr160218 -- to three!
dr160219 -- What's going on? Stu thinks I should run for class president! - I think that's a GREAT idea! It would help your self-image! - If you win, you won't think of yourself as an inept loser anymore! - I never really thought of myself like that. Oh,
dr160219 -- great. Another delusional politician!
dr160220 -- Norm, I think running for class president is a GREAT idea! - It would be a great experience! I don't know how to be president of anything! - Besides, they're having a DEBATE last week! I'm terrified of public speaking! I don't have the

dr160222 -- hypnotist, not a miracle worker!
dr160223 -- You hypnotized Norman into thinking he can win the debate for class president?? - When I snap my fingers, he'll suddenly believe he's Abraham Lincoln! He'll speak with power and conviction! snap! - Can you really do that? Of course I can do
dr160223 -- that!! - I hypnotized him into thinking he was a COW. Remember? Yeah, but that wasn't such a stretch!
dr160224 -- Look! Norman is on TV with the other candidates! I'm so nervous! - Don't be nervous! Patrick is in the audience! - He hypnotized Norman! When he snaps his fingers, Norm will suddenly believe he's Abraham Lincoln! - AND THAT'S SUPPOSED TO MAKE
dr160224 -- ME FEEL LESS NERVOUS?? What could possibly go wrong?
dr160225 -- The next question is for Norman Drabble. Why should we vote for you, Mr. Drabble? - SNAP! - Mr. Drabble? Have you anything to say? - MOOO! OK, let's see what else is on!

dr160306 -- Ralph, I've been thinking about something: I'm very lucky! - You're a good husband and a good dad! - You're honest, trustworthy, and you work hard! - I just thought I should tell you more often! - Is there anything you'd like to tell ME! -
dr160306 -- Tell her you're lucky too! No, tell her to never make that yucky casserole again, because you thought you were gonna die! - I quit! Hey, even *I* don't know why he always listens to me!

dr160309 -- We're home! Wally, why are you so excited? We were only gone 4 hours! - 4 hours for us is like 28 hours for a dog! That's right! - Fortunately, I slept through most of it!
dr160310 -- ...and that's how you silence your phine, dad! - OK! Thank you, son! - I never knew how to do that! - I can't believe I used to let him help with my homework! How do you change the wake-up alarm?

dr160317 -- Happy St. Patrick's Day, Wally! - I hope you like Irish food! I do! - What is it? Irish stew? Corned beef and cabbage? - Lucky charms.

dr160321 -- SHOES Do you have these shoes in a size 17? Yes... - But your feet aren't that big! - Why would you want such big shoes? - For this much money, I want to at least be able to SEE a little bit of 'em!
dr160322 -- We've lived in our house for so long... - Most of the neighbors have come and gone! We should do a better job of getting to know our current neighbors! - I know all of them! You do? - Sure! There's the guy who never makes eye contact, the lady
dr160322 -- with the big dog, the guy who drives too fast...
dr160323 -- * - click! - What was wrong with that song? If you liked the last song, you should've liked THIS song! - Sheesh! I don't think you know WHAT you want! I hate it when my streaming music station talks back to me!

dr160328 -- - I don't get it... - Who needs social media when you have a dog? - Your dog will never unfriend you!
dr160329 -- They say the people resemble their dogs. - Wally is skinny and I'm chubby. - What do we have in common? - You're both shedding!
dr160330 -- Hi, Roly Poly! - Don't look so glum! There's always next year! - NO! PLEASE DON'T ROLL UP INTO A BALL AGAIN!! - Nothing is as sad as a college mascot after a season-ending loss!

dr160403 -- I supposed artists were supposed to paint bowls of FRUIT! It's 2016!

dr160405 -- YES WE CAN - GO! I'm sorry. You'll have to leave! - Why is the college mascot in the testing center, anyway? He's always a bit lost after basketball season!
dr160406 -- ...and for those reasons, I am in favor of the proposition! - Furthermore, I... clap! clap! clap! - The debate team does not need a mascot!! clap clap clap! WELL SAID! clap! clap clap!
dr160407 -- Good news! - It looks like the school mascot finally found a way to keep busy in the off-season... - Intramural ping pong!
dr160408 -- It's interesting how they describe their ice cream sundaes. - "Smothered in whipped cream"..."wallowing in gooey marshmallow"... - "Drowning in chocolate syrup"... - Who wrote this, Stephen King?
dr160409 -- What's for dessert, honeybunch? Nothing. - Nothing?? How come?? - You're on a diet, remember? - But I feel like jello! That's why you're on a diet!

dr160411 -- - - - I have not yet mastered the art of taking a selfie!

dr160413 -- Why do you like to spin around in circles? - It's a waste of energy, and you never GET anywhere! - Dogs are strange!
dr160414 -- Oops! Guess I filled my cereal bowl too high! - Thank goodness for Wally! - sniff sniff sniff - Since when are you a picky eater??
dr160415 -- Hi, Stu! What brings YOU over? Norman, I'd like you to meet my new girlfriend, Bea! - I think she's a keeper! Why couldn't I have been in "Crankshaft"?
dr160416 -- ..Sigh.. - PUNCH PUNCH - WAP! - I think my memory pillow has amnesia!
dr160417 -- Norman! Why are you so late? - When I got into the car to drive home from the library, a ladybug flew inside. - I rolled down the window but it wouldn't fly out! - When I got home, I realized that if the ladybug flew out here, it wouldn't
dr160417 -- know where it was! - It wouldn't know how to get home! That poor ladybug would be all alone without family or friends! - So I drove back to the library to let it out there! - You're all heart, Norm. - No brains, but all heart! Sadly, when I
dr160417 -- rolled down the window again, the ladybug fell down inside the car floor.
dr160418 -- Find a place for this. There's no more room on the attic! - I used to dream that I would one day live in a big, spacious home. - I come closer to this dream with each passing day. - Unfortunately, it's a nursing home!
dr160419 -- ...Sigh... I hate it when people clutter our front porch with fliers... - And it's probably not the best way to advertise your housekeeping service!
dr160420 -- rowf rowf rowf rowf rowf rowf rowf! - Wally, relax! There's noone at the door! - See! Now don't you feel a little silly? - Not as silly as the badger who obviously ran away!
dr160421 -- WALLY, STOP THAT!! - GET OFF THE SOFA!! - WALLY, NO!! - People are so nice! Even though dogs have excellent hearing, they always speak up!
dr160422 -- Dang! - It's weird! When I think about what I'm doing, I always miss! - But when I DON'T think, I usually make it! - I can do anything I don't put my mind to!
dr160423 -- - - GET OFF THE CLEAN LAUNDRY!! - Actions speak louder than words, unless the words are "get off the clean laundry!"
dr160424 -- We're home! - I think we figured out why Wally is always so happy to see us... - It's because one year to us is like seven years to a dog! - That means if we're gone for an hour...to Wally, it's like we're gone for... - - - Seven hours! Thank
dr160424 -- goodness for calculators!
dr160425 -- Uh-oh... - ** - Whew! Brain freeze! - You're eating soup! My brain freezes up easily!
dr160426 -- Here's a useful article... - "Ten things to say to leave a boring conversation". - That reminds me of a time in the third grade when I..., - Well, I've enjoyed talking to you, and I'll be sure to look you up on LinkedIn!
dr160427 -- Ralph, I'm worried about Norman. He spends so much time staring at the phone! Don't worry, honeybunch! It's very normal for young people to look at their phones a lot! I'm sure it's only... - Never mind!
dr160428 -- Dad, I'm in a quandry... - Have a bowl of ice cream. Whenever I'm down, a big bowl of ice cream always helps! - I'm not down, I'm just in a quandry! Oh, OK... - In that case, I'd recommend a box of girl scout cookies!
dr160429 -- - SCHLURGLE SCHLURGLE - I finished it already?? Dang! - Never daydream when you're drinking a milkshake!
dr160430 -- Great job on the jigsaw puzzle, honeybunch! - I can't believe you did it all by yourself! So many pieces! Such detail! So amazing! - - But you finished it a month ago and it would be nice to use the dinner table again, so how about if... Not
dr160430 -- yet!
dr160501 -- GOOD GRAVY! What's wrong? - Nothing, Echo. - AY, CARAMBA! What now?? - Nothing. - HEAVENS TO MURGATROYD! Norman, what on earth is wrong? - Sometimes I have flashbacks of dumb things I've done and I get embarrassed all over again! I thought *I*
dr160501 -- was the only one with that problem! - I call them "Drabblations". I call them "Echos". - JUMPIN' JEHOSAPHAT! SUFFERIN' SUCCOTASH! They really ARE made for each other!
dr160502 -- Oops! I spilled some orange juice! - The paper towels are way over there, and then I'd have to bend all the way down and wipe it up. - Or I could just step on it and soak it up with my sock. - Or my faithful dog could just lick it up! Sorry.
dr160502 -- I only like freshly squeezed!
dr160503 -- It's a lot of work to get a paper towel, so maybe I'll just soak up this spilled orange juice with my sock. - What a great idea! Am I a genius or what! - Of course, now my sock is wet and I'm going to track it around, and I'll have even more
dr160503 -- to clean up! - Apparently, I'm the "or what".
dr160504 -- I thought I was clever using my sock to soak up a spill on the floor. - But now I realize I'm going to track it all over, and I'll have even more to clean up! - Hey, I know: I'll hop on one foot over to my shoes and slip 'em on! - hop!
dr160504 -- SPLASH! hop SPLASH!
dr160505 -- Oh, no... - AAAAAAAHHH!! - Dad, are you all right?? - Yeah, it was just momentary panic when you think you've lost your smartphone!
dr160506 -- I always like being with you, Norman! REALLY? - Why on earth would you like being with ME, echo? - I'm not cool, I'm not handsome, I'm not rich... That's OK! - I like you just the way you aren't!
dr160507 -- Echo seems to like me! - Maybe I should put my arm around her! - I've never put my arm around anyone before. I'm not sure the best way to do it gracefully. - That wasn't it.
dr160508 -- Oh, boy! It's almost time for the kids to come home from school! - Our little house comes back to life after being so quiet all day! - I get so excited about seeing their sweet faces come through that door! - 3:15 in the afternoon is my
dr160508 -- favorite time of day! - YOU are! No, YOU are! - SLAM! NOBODY TOUCH MY XBOX!! - 7:20 in the morning, when they leave again, is a close second! OW! STOP IT! THAT'S MINE!!
dr160509 -- Ralph, look at what I bought at a garage sale... - A piano?? I've always wanted one! It's in very good condition! - I only see one problem with it... - We're gonna need a bigger house! I kind of like it in the kitchen!
dr160510 -- Hello, is this the Dollar Store? - How much are your pocket protectors? - Do they ever go on sale? 'k, bye. - Dang! Try the $0.99 store!
dr160511 -- Stu, I'm torn between two girls... - Echo is nice to me. Wendy is not. Echo makes me feel good about myself. Wendy does not. - What is it about Wendy you like? She has a beautiful smile. - Really? I saw it once when she ran over my foot.
dr160512 -- Wendy, what is it about me that annoys you? Where do I start? - Your nerdiness, your goofy grin, the fact that you wear a t-shirt under your t-shirt... - Echo, what is it about me that you like me so much? Where do I start? - Your nerdiness,
dr160512 -- your goofy grin, the fact that you wear a t-shirt under your t-shirt... Doesn't everyone?
dr160513 -- Norm, there's no doubt about it! You need to break off with Wendy! - Echo is the girl for you! - Go tell Wendy face-to-face that you're finished! Take charge! Be bold! You're right, Stu! I'm going to do it! - Maybe I'll just text her instead!
dr160513 -- Good old nerdy Norm!
dr160514 -- Stu, before I send this 'break-up' text to Wendy, tell me if it's OK. - We're finished. I found somebody better. Good by forever. Perfect! send it! - There! I sent it! My troubles are over! - ding *
dr160515 -- It's a beautiful spring day! - Ralph, let's go take a long walk together! Great idea, honeybunch! - Taking long walks with you is one of my favorite things to do! - She walks faster than I do, so I get a little peace and quiet!
dr160516 -- You were right, Stu! Echo is the girl for me! - I feel so much better since I sent that "farewell" text to Wendy! - I'd love to see the expression on Wendy's face right about now! -
dr160517 -- Modern technology is wonderful! I ended my relationship with Wendy by sending a TEXT! - It felt so good to text all things I've always been wimpy to say! - Now I can devote all my attention to the true love of my life, Echo! - Wouldn't it be
dr160517 -- funny if you sent it to the wrong girl? Ha! Even I'M not THAT stupid!!
dr160518 -- I have officially chosen Echo over Wendy! - I sent Wendy a "farewell" text! I listed all of her rude qualities! - I fact, I'm on a roll! I think I'll text a few more! - ding!
dr160519 -- Hi, Norman. Wendy! You're speaking to me?? - Why wouldn't I? I figured you'd be steamed about those "break-up" texts I sent you! - Why would you send me a breakup text? - It's not like we were ever together! NOW you tell me!!
dr160520 -- Are you sure you didn't read my break-up text, Wendy? What did I say? - I said that you can be difficult at times and your heart isn't always filled with charity. - And that if you were a "Jeopardy" question, you'd only be worth $200, and
dr160520 -- that you wouldn't last very long on "The Bachelor". - And that you make Kylo Ren seem like a sweetheart. I'm pretty sure I would've remembered that.
dr160521 -- I can't believe you didn't see my breakup texts, Wendy! - I tried to find the perfect words to describe how mean you are, and why I never want to see you again! - Oh, I see what happened. I sent them to Echo. - I SENT THEM TO ECHO??!! Oddly
dr160521 -- enough, I'm starting to like you better!
dr160522 -- OK, OK...I'll let you back in! - Hey! What's wrong with you? - You act like you want to come in, then you run away! - Fine! I'll close the door again! - Oh, for heaven's sake! - HEY! - Fine' I'll close the door again! - He'll learn some day!
dr160522 -- Fine! I'll let you back in! HEY!! I hope ONE of them learns!
dr160523 -- I meant to send a breakup text to Wendy, but I sent it to Echo by mistake! Now my calls to Echo aren't going through! - I think I've been blocked! What should I do, daddy? Who knows? I can't help with these modern-day problems! - When I was a
dr160523 -- kid, we had three R's: reading, 'riting, and 'rithmetic. - Now it's the three T's: texting, tweeting, and trolling!
dr160524 -- I sent Echo a breakup text that I meant to send to Wendy! - I can't apologize because Echo has blocked my calls and texts! I don't know what to do! I've GOT IT!! - Go to wherever she works and bring her flowers in front of everyone! Great
dr160524 -- idea! - She works at Rosie Rat's Pizza! She's the one in the rat costume! Maybe I DON'T got it!
dr160525 -- Rosie Rat's PIZZA & Games Excuse me, where is Rosie Rat? - Over there, with all the kids! - Yes, that's definitely Echo in the costume! I recognize her perfume! - Which, come to think of it, smells a lot like pepperoni!
dr160526 -- Excuse me, kids... - Echo, I beg your forgiveness! Those mean tests were intended for someone else! - You're the one for me! Please accept these flowers! I've never seen anyone give flowers to a rat! You don't watch "The Bachelor"?
dr160527 -- Thank you for accepting my flowers, Echo! - Oh, what the heck! I can't let this moment slip away... - Let's kiss! - Sorry. Echo's on a break! WAAH!
dr160528 -- Norman! Echo! I came to apologize! - Those mean texts weren't intended for you! Please don't block me from texting you! - I didn't block you! After I read your texts, my phone broke because I accidentally dropped it... - Really hard...against
dr160528 -- a wall! Good! I was afraid you were mad!
dr160529 -- "WELCOME"??? It's an accent rug! That's it. I'm migrating to another comic strip!
dr160530 -- - - Why do you always star at me? Some people are observers of life... - I'm an observer of wife! I hate it when he has a day off!
dr160531 -- - Ralph, please stop staring at me while I do housework! - I can't help it, honeybunch! You're my eye candy! - Sugarless, but still...
dr160601 -- - Excuse me, Wally! - Your job is to always be right in my way, isn't it? - I thought you said that was MY job!
dr160602 -- Wann go hit golf balls, Ralph? Sure! - Sorry to leave you on my day off, nut No-Neck invited me to hit balls! - Bye! - You really don't need to pay me, June! A deal's a deal! Here's an extra $20. Take him to lunch, too!
dr160603 -- I bought some ice cream and put it into the freezer. - But don't touch it! - We're saving it for Sunday. - Trying not to touch the ice cream is like trying not to look at a text message! * bing!
dr160604 -- Excellent! - The scale says I weigh 165 pounds! - I always go with the lesser of the two!
dr160605 -- WIFF! - Try again, Penny! - WIFF! Almost! - SNARL! - Why on earth mould you buy a Pinata that looks like a badger? I thought it was a raccoon! Thanks, Wally! Just trying to save lives!
dr160606 -- - - - The thought police never bother me.
dr160607 -- Oh, boy! Summer is here! I'll go put on my trunks! - It's fun to see dad's face light up! I think that was just the glare from his scalp!
dr160608 -- I just noticed something...I'm the only one in this family that gets put on a leash! - I hope the others don't feel less important!
dr160609 -- Darn! - They returned my letter! - Insufficient postage. Told you! - Why do they call it a "Forever Stamp" if you can't peel it off and use it again??
dr160610 -- Dad, my goal is to have people think of me as a "go to" guy! - I've ALWAYS thought of you as a "Go To" guy, Norm! Really? - Yeah, so go to the store and get me some ice cream! - That's not the kind of "go to" I meant! And then go to bed!
dr160611 -- Forget it, Wally! It's not time to wake up! This is my day off! - I don't care what you do or how obnoxious you try to be... - Nothing will get me out of this bed! - Wanna' bet? pant pant pant No!! Not the dog breath!
dr160612 -- WALLY KNOCK KNOCK - Sigh... ROWF ROWF ROWF ROWF ROWF ROWF! - ROWF ROWF rowf ROWF rowf ROWF rowf ROWF ROWF ROWF rowf rowf! Hello! - rowf rowf ROWF ROWF ROWF rowf ROWF ROWF rowf rowf rowf rowf ROWF ROWF ROWF rowf rowf rowf ROWF ROWF ROWF ROWF
dr160612 -- rowf rowf rowf ROWF! Can I interest you in a home alarm system? - ROWF ROWF ROWF ROWF ROWF ROWF ROWF ROWF ROWF ROWF ROWF ROWF ROWF ROWF ROWF! WHAT? Never mind.
dr160613 -- At this new yogurt shop, you make it yourself. - The price is determined by weight! - Here, hold my yogurt! This could get pricey!
dr160614 -- Serve Yourself - According to the scale, that'll be $7.50! - Why do you have a tip jar? I made the yogurt myself! Why should I tip you? - What would your wife say if someone told her you spent $7.50 on a yogurt? Here, keep the change.
dr160615 -- Do you want me to drive, dad? - Why would I want you to drive? - Because I'm younger and my reflexes are quicker! - Hey, what hurts? You hand is stuck in the power window.
dr160616 -- QUACK QUACK This phone is so annoying! - That's weird. No message! - I think my phone is defective! - People with pet ducks should probably choose a different text alert!
dr160617 -- Honeybunch, I realize Norman drew this picture when he was little... - So it obviously has sentimental value... - But how long do we need to leave it on the refrigerator? Actually he drew it last Tuesday! It took me all night!
dr160618 -- For heaven's sake! What are you whimpering about? I fed you, I took you for a walk...why are you following me around? - Sorry. I'll put you outside if I have to!
dr160619 -- Z - Z*Z - - WOW! THIS IS THE BEST FATHER'S DAY EVER! - DONUTS What'll it be, Ralph? I'll start with a maple bar! He asked for breakfast in bed!
dr160620 -- Dad, I need to go to the mall. Can I take your car? - The mall is only two blocks away. I suggest you walk. - If you walk, you'll burn calories and feel good! - And he won't reprogram all of my radio buttons!
dr160621 -- Now, what did honeybunch ask me to get at the store? - I used to write it all down, but I have lousy penmanship and I could never read my writing! - So my kids taught me how to text notes to myself! Let's see what I wrote... - Nxbecf loom3ip
dr160621 -- mowk I have lousy textmanship, too!
dr160622 -- Don't worry about getting older, dad... - You know what they say... - "50 is the new 30!" - Who says that? I'm guessing people turning 50.
dr160623 -- Now, which one of these operates the CD player? Is it this one or that one or... - TV remotes are like coat hangers. They multiply!
dr160624 -- Why doesn't our TV remote work?? - WHAP WHAP WHAP! - Now it works! I just heard that the inventor of the TV remote died. - I hope they whapped him a few times to make sure!
dr160625 -- Ralph, please remind me to send a birthday card to my aunt. No way! - Then if you forget, it will be MY fault! - Please? Oh, OK. - Remind me to remind your mother to... No way!

dr160627 -- Norman has decided to become atriathlete! Really?? - He's training outside! - Wow! A triathlete! - squeaky squeaky squeak!
dr160628 -- OK, Norm! I'm in the pool! Coming! - Why do you fill it up after he gets in? If I fill it BEFORE he gets in, we lose a lot of water to overspill!
dr160629 -- Good heavens! I almost forgot to pick up Penny from dance lessons! - Honestly, sometimes I feel like a plate-spinner around here! - Wait a minute, that's not true at all! - Plate-spinners get paid!
dr160630 -- Honestly, Ralph, sometimes I feel like a plate-spinner! - I know what you mean, honeybunch... - Sometimes I feel like aoinata! - Our household is like "party-central"!
dr160701 -- chirp chirp chirp - Hello? I think you're due for an upgrade!
dr160702 -- Spell-check turns all of my texts into gibberish! - "Okie-dokie" got changed to "Okie-dole"! - "Yippie yi yo ki yay" got changed to "Yippee ago kayak". - "Yabba dabba doo" got changed to "Yah baby sabbath doo". Who are you texting? The
dr160702 -- Muppets?
dr160703 -- Hand me the clickers, Norm! - Why do you call them "clickers", Dad? - Because, in the old days, they used to click! That's annoying! - I remember when we didn't even HAVE clickers! What did you DO?? - I had to get up off the couch, walk all
dr160703 -- the way over to the TV and change channels by HAND! That's TERRIBLE! - Not only that, but we only had 7 CHANNELS to choose from! - I had no idea your childhood was so difficult! AND MOST OF THE SHOWS WERE IN BLACK AND WHITE!! You may not have
dr160703 -- been "The Greatest Generation", but you deserve honorable mention!
dr160704 -- - DONUT CHAMP 1987 - You actually did it!! - You donated my favorite old shirt! What were the odds??

dr160706 -- Today I start my summer job at Dairy King! - I make people happy and I get to wear a uniform! - I'm a respected member of the work force! - What do you think of me now, all you girls from high school who I was afraid to ask out on a date, but
dr160706 -- who would've said no if I had?
dr160707 -- Your order is ready, Stu! - One extra-thick chocolate "blitzer"! - And to prove how thick it is, we always turn it upside down! - Looks like this one needs a little more time in the mixer!
dr160708 -- Here's your hand-dipped cone! - That'll be $3,50! - I'll get your change... - Pardon the chocolate.  That's my cone-dipping hand!
dr160709 -- SIGH... - I can't believe we have to go to another wedding reception! - There's always something hanging over my head! - There's always something hanging under your head, too. Leave my turkey-neck out of this!!

dr170725 -- Dad, you've given me good advice over the years. - For example, you've always told me to stay on the path and things will be all right. - Maybe YOU should stay on the path! Just hold on and look for my ball!
dr170726 -- putt! - DANG! - I missed my chance for a quadruple bogey! So close!
dr170727 -- BOOF! - BOOF! - CHOP! - I'm only counting that as one stroke because it's not my fault they put a bunch of sand next to the green!
dr170728 -- Well, hello, little squirrel! - How nice is it to live on a beautiful golf course like this? - Actually, it's not all fun and games. I have to look out for errant balls and speeding carts! The food's not bad, though. Especially over at the
dr170728 -- garbage can next to the snack bar. People throw away their hot dogs because... - I have to putt now. Sorry if I talk too much, but nobody's ever asked me a question before!
dr170729 -- Regardless of how poorly you played... - If you learned something, it was a good day on the golf course! - I learned a lot! - For one thing, I never knew golf carts had airbags! Thank goodness!
dr170730 -- More DRABBLATIONS From Ralph Drabble - People in my age should not try to use emojis. I sure hope that's a happy face! - Some say my scalp is half-empty. I say it's half-full. I can see my reflection! - I am my dog's comfort pet. VET There
dr170730 -- there. - Never talk politics during a blood pressure test. - Trying not to touch the ice cream in your freezer is like trying not to look at a text message. Don't touch that! - There's no substitute for hard work, unless you have

dr170809 -- ...and then Carrie called and asked if I wanted to take a walk so I said "sure" so we were walking and bumped into Kristine who joined us, so we walked past the school and saw Susan, who was on her way to the grocery store to buy ingredients
dr170809 -- for the Italian dinner she plans to make for her husband's birthday because that's his second favorite kind of food because she already made movie - - Are You Still Listening? I'm Still Listening She's getting more and more like a music

dr170922 -- rake rake rake rake - WHIRRRRRRR! - Happy first day of fall, Ralph!
dr170923 -- WHIRRRRRRRRRR! - Why go to the trouble of dusting when you have a leaf-blower?

dr170924 -- GUBER I just need you to drive me three doors down!
dr170925 -- Dad and Mr. Steinbauer are having a leafblower war! - Mr. Steinbauer keeps blowing his leaves into your yard, and dad keeps blowing them back! - Who's winning? It's a stalemate.

dr170930 -- Get your video camera ready... - BOOM-SHAKA-LAKA!! - And you didn't think I could slamdunk? I'll edit out the 16 seconds it took to climb the ladder!
dr171001 -- We'll be back in a few hours! - He always looks so sad when we leave him! - I know. I can't stand that pathetic look on his face! - Sometimes it helps to distract him with food and then sneak out. That might work! - Here are some treats! -
dr171001 -- Thanks, honeybunch! I'll bet he practices that look in the mirror!
dr171002 -- TRICK OR TREAT! - It's the first week of October! - We came early because you always eat all the Halloween candy before we get here! - I know! Next year, try to get here before Labor Day!

dr171007 -- Dad, your wallet is too fat! It's probably full of stuff you don't need anymore. - Like a punch card for the Healthy Rice Bowl Restaurant! Ten punches and I get a free one! I find it hard to believe you're going to eat more healthy rice bowls

dr171028 -- Mornin', kids! What's with the cap? - It's my "Saturday Morning" cap! - I don't need to get cleaned up for work, so I wear a cap so you don't have to look at my unkempt hair! - It's not like you have much left to worry about! Maybe you should

dr171122 -- Tomorrow is my favorite day, Penny... - Most people have grown up thinking it's just a day of parades and football. - But I grew up thinking of it as something more. Me too.. - Black Friday Eve!
dr171123 -- I love coming up north to spend thanksgiving at Uncle Jim's farm! - It's a weekend reunion of family and old friends! - I love the joyous sounds of children at play! - Although it gets a little competitive when the adults play! THAT'S PASS
dr171123 -- INTERFERENCE ON GRANDMA!!
dr171124 -- Isn't it wonderful of uncle Jim and aunt Barbara to invite the entire family to their farm every thanksgiving? I guess... - The only thing I don't like about family reunions is that my relatives always show up! beep beep!
dr171125 -- Thanksgiving weekend at Uncle Jim's farm is filled with tradition... - Wednesday night is the kid's talent show, Thursday is turkey and football, Friday is game night... - And Saturday night is when he shows his vacation photos. I think he's
dr171125 -- just trying to get rid of us at some point! - ...and here we are at some other cool place...
dr171126 -- We have a long drive home from uncle Jim's house. Let me share the driving, Ralph! OK! Thanks! - chirp chirp Will you please read the text I just got? - It's from your friend Dottie. "Hi, June! How was your thanksgiving?" - Text her back for

dr171126 -- drive! We're not even out of uncle Jim's driveway!

dr171129 -- I'm trying a new recipe for dinner! - I watched them make it on the Food Channel! - ...sigh... What's wrong? - I watched them remodel a bathroom on the Do-It-Yourself channel, but it doesn't mean *I* should go try it!
dr171130 -- I'm hungry. - Unfortunately, everyone's busy decorating for Christmas! - Fine, I'll just sit here until they... - Notice me.
dr171201 -- I'm almost done decorating for Christmas already! - Last year I took a photo of all my decorations. - So this year I know exactly where to put everything! It saved so much time! - You've been decorating since October. I know! I used to start
dr171201 -- in august!
dr170202 -- Hmmm... - Looks to me like I'm down at least a pound and a half this morning! - YES! - It might be more accurate to weigh yourself! Guesstimating is less scary!
dr170203 -- I'm telling you, when I put those lights away in January, I wound then neatly! - I think your memory might be a little fuzzy, dad! - Yeah, especially because you didn't put them away until august! - I guess we won't be winning the neighborhood
dr170203 -- lighting contest this year! Maybe they'll have a "least inspirational" award! I'm sure the badgers had something to do with this!
dr171204 -- I love delivering cookies to our friends this time of year! - It's just odd that no one has been home tonight, Weill it IS December! They could be out shopping! - No, my friends are just like me. They finished their shopping in October! Oh
dr171204 -- yeah, huh. - Maybe they're all out doing their Valentine's Day shopping! Now that's a possibility!
dr171205 -- Gee, there seems to be a lot of cars in front of the Smiths' home! - Just wait here. I'll take the Christmas cookies to their door! - No wonder none of our friends are home tonight. The Smiths are having a party. - ...a party that WE WEREN'T
dr171205 -- INVITED TO!
dr171206 -- The reason none of our friends are home tonight is because the Smiths are having a party! - A party we obviously weren't invited to! I just left the cookies on the porch and ran back to the car! - I was MORTIFIED! - We have no friends! Does
dr171206 -- that men we can eat the rest of the cookies?
dr171207 -- Honeybunch, if we didn't get invited to a party, it's because of ME, not you! - I'm not a popular guy! It doesn't reflect on YOU! - I'm not the life of the party because I'm not a good conversationalist! - Although that could be because I can
dr171207 -- never get a word in edgewise!
dr171208 -- I got a text from the Smiths thanking us for the cookies... - They asked us why we never r.v.s.p.'d to their party invitation! Ralph, you get the mail...did you see an invitation? - Wait...did it have a picture of a wreath and say "you're
dr171208 -- invited to the Smiths' for holiday cheer! Please r.s.v.p."? - Sounds about right. Sorry, it doesn't ring a bell!
dr171209 -- YOU THREW OUT OUR INVITATION TO THE SMITHS' PARTY?? Possibly... - I may not have realized it was an invitation! - I probably thought it was just another Christmas card! - YOU THROW AWAY OUT CHRISTMAS CARDS?? Hey, I have an idea! Let's all go
dr171209 -- caroling or something!
dr171210 -- I'm so glad you could come over today! Can we turn on the football game, gramma? - Sure! I'll do it because this remote is kind of tricky! What channel? 1011 - Channel 1-0-1-1... - There! Is that it? No, that's channel 1101 You have to push
dr171210 -- the buttons kind of fast. - OK, let's try again... Now you're on 1110! - Let's see here... Now it's 1111! - 0001 0101! 1001! - This remote is almost as hard to work as my cell phone! Now I understand why gramma only watches channel 2!
dr171211 -- Christmas shopping isn't as exciting as it used to be. - DING DONG! HE'S HERE!! - Delivery for Mrs. Drabble! - I mean, IT'S here! Now, what were you saying? Never mind!
dr171212 -- - skattle skattle skattle - skattle skattle skattle skattle - 
dr171213 -- ** And a partridge in a pear tree! * - OK, bye! Facetime caroling is good, but I miss going door-to-door! Can we sit down to do this?
dr171214 -- - - What? I guess it's better than needing a walker!
dr171215 -- Still no presents for me under the tree! - What's up with that?? - Relax. We just haven't wrapped them yet. - Oh, OK. ...or bought 'em!
dr171216 -- Oh, honeybunch! - OUCH! OW!! rip pick scratch rip shred - - BAP! Stupid cat!

dr171219 -- There are more Christmas songs with dogs in them than cats! - "Angles and SHEPHERDS," "WIENER Wonderland," "Oh Little HOUND of Bethlehem"... - There are lots of Christmas songs about cats, too! Name one.. - Besides "Fleas Navidad". skritch
dr171219 -- skritch skritch

dr180121 -- - Unless, of course, you just now decided to take me to wherever I guessed first. Guess where we're going after that!
dr180122 -- Dang! They're not in this drawer, either! - I have three pairs of sunglasses, and I can't find ANY of them! That's OK. I may not be letting you out of the house today!

dr180210 -- are very trusting, too. At least they're honest!
dr180211 -- Come on, Wally! We have to go outside for a walk! - I know it's raining, but you still need to go! - I understand that you don't like to get wet. - But dad said you need to go for a walk, so we're going for a walk! - How can we do this so you
dr180211 -- won't mind so much? -
dr180212 -- I never know what kind of Valentine's card to pick for your mom. - You've been married a long time, so give her the mushiest card you can find! - I haven't known Echo for long, so I'm giving her a NON-mushy card: "Have a nice Valentine's
dr180212 -- Day." - That should get you a nice handshake! Anything mushier than that and she might try to kiss me!
dr180213 -- I like this card you picked out for Echo: "Have a nice Valentine's Day"! - You can't give that card to Mom! She needs a mushier Valentine! Try this... - That's the mushiest card they have! It says everything mom would like to hear! - She'll
dr180213 -- have no doubt you worship the ground she walks on! - If not, I'll be SLEEPING on the ground she walks on!
dr180214 -- For Valentine's Day, I gave Echo a very non-mushy card. I don't want her to get the wrong idea. - But I picked out an EXTREMELY mushy card for dad to give mom! - How do you like your card, honeybunch? "Have a nice Valentine's Day"? That's
dr180214 -- it??! Uh-oh... - * * sniff! *
dr180215 -- I came by to thank you for the lovely Valentine's card! - I never knew the depth of your feelings for me! Who knew you were so romantic?! - I always thought we were whatever, but I can see now you think of us as FORever! - I may have
dr180215 -- accidentally just gotten engaged! Thanks again for mixing up our Valentine cards!
dr180216 -- Market I'd like to return this Valentine's card. Return it??! - It didn't work. My wife didn't like it and it just got me in trouble. - Who ever heard of returning a Valentine's card?? - Hello. I'd like to return this Valentine's card I bought
dr180216 -- for my husband. It was too nice.
dr180217 -- - tap tap tap - tap tap tappity tap - How do you turn up the brightness on books?
dr180218 -- Come on, baby! Just make a free throw! - You can do it! Nice and easy... - KLANK! DANG! DANG! DANG!! - Ralph, don't get so upset about sports! - It's just a game! Life goes on! - The players are doing their best. Sometimes you win, sometimes
dr180218 -- you... - KLANK! OH, COME ON! MY GRANDMA CAN MAKE A FREE THROW!!!
dr180219 -- Norman, I can't tell you how much I loved your valentine's card! - I think I need to tell Echo that my dad and I got our cards mixed up! - No! Don't say a word!! - Yeah, keep quiet! See? Even HE'S not that dumb!
dr180220 -- Echo, about that mushy Valentine's card I gave you... - NO!! Don't tell her it was the wrong card!! - I meant every word of it! - Whew! It's sad when your "dumb self" is smarter than your actual self!

dr180222 -- I love this time of year... - Everyone's thoughts turn to baseball as players start arriving for spring training! - SSKKRRAKK - Almost everyone. The NHL playoffs start in six weeks, eh!
dr180223 -- Why are you suddenly into ice hockey, Patrick? - I watched a game on TV and I couldn't believe how fun it was! - Hockey is a combination of speed, skill, and utter insanity! - How can you not love a bunch of guys flying around with sticks in
dr180223 -- their hands and blades on their feet? Watch the carpet, please!
dr180224 -- Church can sure be boring! - How is a kid supposed to sit still for a whole hour?! - I just pretend I'm in the penalty box!
dr180225 -- Whew! All this yard work is starting to hurt my back a little, honeybunch! - Well then don't sit around and watch me in that little chair!
dr180226 -- PUTT ! - - TOK ! - There are no goalies in golf, Patrick!
dr180227 -- NO EVENT PARKING - If there's no event, why would we need to park? Let's just listen to the radio, OK, Norm?
dr180228 -- See how much better our bedroom looks with this chair in the corner... - Instead of that ugly exercise bike with your clothes thrown all over it? - Yes, it's very nice, honeybunch! -
dr180301 -- I love march! - The weather turns warm, the leaves grow back, and baseball begins! - I also love October! How come? - The weather turns cool, the leaves fall off, and baseball ends!
dr180302 -- Here are my sheets, mom! - Thank you, Patrick. - How many times have I told you not to sleep in your hockey skates?
dr180303 -- Wow, honeybunch! You're looking... - Oops! I just remembered I'm never allowed to tell you that you look thinner... - Because that implies that you looked heavier before! - So forget it! You're sounding smarter!
dr180304 -- No thanks! - Forget it! - I'll pass on that, too. - That's dumb. - That's dumber than the last one! - No way I'll spend money on that! - OH, GREAT! NOT ANOTHER ONE!! Maybe you should go take a walk during the previews!
dr180305 -- Hey, this is interesting... - Studies indicate that there is a chemical in french fries that may be a cure for baldness! - Let's go tell dad! - I think he already heard.
dr180306 -- We're going out to a restaurant, Wally. - You can't go because you're a dog. - You'd be loud and annoying and stare at other people's food. - Plus, you eat like an animal! Maybe you shouldn't go, either!
dr180307 -- We're back from the restaurant, Wally! - Look! I brought you a doggie bag! - - Just the bag?? I got hungry again on the way home!
dr180308 -- The best part about coming home from work is... - Being greeted at the door by my faithful dog! - Do I know you? Being greeted by the cat is not the same!
dr180309 -- Gimme five, dad! - SLAP! - Gimme five, Ralph! - Thanks!
dr180310 -- Ralph, why are you awake at this hour? I'm too excited to sleep, honeybunch! This is a big night! - It's baseball opening day eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve eve! March is a long month around here!
dr180311 -- I can't remember the name of that actor. It's driving me crazy! Ask Alexander! - Ask WHO? The voice.assistance device I just bought! - Just say "Hey, Alexander..." and then ask any question you want. Alexander will answer it! It's amazing!
dr180311 -- Try it! OK - Hey, Alexander! What is the name of the guy with a beard who talks kind of funny in this John Wayne movie that I can never remember the name of? - I'm sorry. I an unable to answer that! - What a piece of junk!
dr180312 -- Dogs are very thoughtful. - Instead of bothering our masters to feed us every time we're hungry... - We just help ourselves to the kitchen trash! - WALLY!! please...no need to thank me!
dr180313 -- Wally! Don't eat out of the kitchen trash! - That's disgusting!! - Hey, who threw away that perfectly good slice of leftover pizza? - 
dr180314 -- We're home! - Thank goodness! We missed you! - We did? - Tell me again who these people are.
dr180315 -- I'll feed you as soon as I can, Wally! - Stop following me around! - Why can't you be more patient? It was only five minutes late! - That's over half an hour in dog years!
dr180316 -- Hmmm... - - What are you looking for? I have no idea but the pros do it on TV!
dr180317 -- Powerful you have become. I'm thinking Today must be Irish! - IRISH?? Yeah. He's green and he talks like Barry Fitzgerald! Careful you must be!
dr180318 -- Bye, mom! Bye, Norman! - Remember never to look at your phone when you're driving! - Not even when you're at a red light! - Don't worry. I hardly ever look at my phone. Not even to check news and sports? - Nope. I prefer newspapers! - SPORTS
dr180319 -- Before baseball season starts, let's take the stadium tour! - They show you all the cool stuff like the dugouts and locker rooms! I can buy tickets for 10% off! - You want to buy tickets to go to an empty stadium where there's no game? -
dr180139 -- Sounds fun to me! After that we can go to a movie that isn't playing!
dr180320 -- Stadium Tour <-- It's so cool being in the stadium when it's virtually empty! - And yet somehow, there's still a line for the bathroom! WOMEN
dr180321 -- I can't believe we#re in the PRESS BOX! Nice view! - I'd love to be a baseball announcer! You'd need to think of a memorable catchphrase. - Something you'd say every time the team wins! Hmmm, how about... - "GET IN YOUR CAR AND SIT IN PARKING
dr180321 -- LOT TRAFFIC FOR THE NEXT HOUR 'CUZ THIS GAME IS OVER!!"
dr180322 -- I can't believe our tour guide is letting us sit over here! - I will now fulfill my lifelong dream of spitting sunflower seeds in a major league dugout! - What? Oh, OK. - I can't take you anywhere, can I?
dr180323 -- OK, let's go. - GO?? We can't go now! The stadium tour isn't over yet! - Why do you want to leave early? What kind of baseball fan are you? - A typical one. I want to beat the traffic!
dr180324 -- Wow, Patrick! You've really grown since the last time I measured you! - Way to go! Thanks, eh! Next time, take off your hockey skates.
dr180325 -- - skattle skattle skattle - skattle skattle - skattle skattle skattle skattle - skattle skattle skattle - skattle skattle skattle - BOINK - I think it's cute how Wally needs a running start to jump up on the bed!

dr180328 -- Hmmm... - - - Oops! That's one way to make room in the trash pail!
dr180329 -- Wally! I can't believe you got into the kitchen trash again! - Look at the mess you made! - Naughty dog! - What's the big deal? Someone always cleans it up!
dr180330 -- ...Sigh... - GET OUT OF MY CHAIR, YOU DUMB CAT! - How many times do I have to tell you?? - Yeah, you dumb cat!
dr180331 -- 't was the night before Easter... - And the bunny's all set... - To sneak into the house... - Which he may come to regret! Grrrrr!
dr180401 -- I found one behind the plant! ? - I found one in a SHOE! - I found one under the couch! ? - I found one behind the drapes! - I found one in Oogie's scratching post! I don't believe it! - You RE-DID all the EGGS?? The Easter Bunny didn't do a
dr180401 -- very good job this year. - Maybe he's just getting older and doesn't like to bend over very far!
dr180402 -- Which is smarter, a dog or a cat? - A dog, definitely. - See? - If you're so smart, why are you asking a duck? They're nicer, too.
dr180403 -- Why do you say dogs are smarter than cats? - The cerebral cortex of a dog's brain contains more neurons than does the cerebral cortex of a cat. - What's neuron? - The defense rests.
dr180404 -- I still say cats are smarter than dogs! Nope. - Dog brains have about 530 million cortical neurons. Cat brains have about 260 million. - Human brains have about 16 billion. - I demand a recount! How many do duck brains have? 3.
dr180405 -- It's not true that dogs are smarter than cats! - Cats are brilliant! No, they're not! - For example, you're supposed to claw the scratching post! I know that! I'm just ornery! pick pick pick
dr180406 -- So what if cats aren't as smart as dogs? - Cats are smarter than a lot of things! pick pick claw - It could be worse! - Why do they make spray paint cans that look just like hair spray cans?! See?
dr180407 -- I can't believe I used spray paint instead of hair spray! - I've got a date with Echo and I can't get the paint off! - She'll understand. She seems a lot like you! -
dr180408 -- WALLY Mistakes were made.
dr180409 -- I got a card from Wendy?? - I didn't even think she LIKED me! - "To the man of my dreams... - "Happy belated April's Fool's Day!"
dr180410 -- VEEP VEEP VEEP - VEEP VEEP VEEP VEEP - Oh, here it it! - Dan! IO miss a lot of calls when I wear cargo pants!
dr180411 -- It's not unusual to have a comfort pet. - It can be a dog or even a cat! - Ducks are a stretch, though. Bob is actually a rare South American parrot!
dr180412 -- What is it, Wally? - Where do you want to go? - PARK PARK PARK! - I wish Wally could say something besides "bark bark bark!" They're hopeless!
dr180413 -- RALPH! Thank goodness you're here! - We were so worried about you! - We missed you so much!! - I like coming in to donut shops that I haven't been to for a while. They're always thrilled to see me! We were already afraid you were dieting!
dr180414 -- Hic! You drank that entire bottle of diet soda, dad? - Yeah, I accidentally ate a donut today and ruined my diet... - So, to offset it, I drank diet soda. It's OK to eat high-calorie stuff if you drink diet soda afterward. - This bottle is to
dr180414 -- offset the burrito I also had. How do you accidentally eat a donut?
dr180415 -- Z - WHIRRRRRR! - Oogie - - - WHO WANTS ICE CREAM?! - We don't have any. I was just asking for a friend!
dr180416 -- Hey, Alexander...how's the weather right now? - The temperature is 62°. Thank you! - You don't need to say thank you! It's just an electronic gadget! - Who's the rude guy? My husband. Just ignore him!
dr180417 -- Honeybunch, why do you treat Alexander like a real person? It's just an electronic gadget! - Talking to Alexander is fun! Ask him to pay you a compliment! - Hey, Alexander...pay me a compliment! - You look like you've lost weight! Really? You
dr180417 -- can tell?
dr180418 -- Hey, Alexander...please tell me the weather forecast! - Expect showers today! Thank you! - Go get the umbrella, Ralph! How come she's nicer to you than she is to me?
dr180419 -- The kids are asleep, honeybunch! Ask Alexander to play some romantic music! - I can't ask him that! I'd be too embarrassed! For pete's sake! It's an electronic gadget! I'LL ask! - Hey, Alexander...play some...uhhyou know...romantic music. -
dr180419 -- See? That wasn't so embarrassing! Here you go, lover boy... Then why is your face red?
dr180420 -- Who got into my plate of brownies? - Hey, Alexander...who ate the brownies I made for the book club? - Your husband. RALPH? - I'm sorry to be the one to break the news. I think I'm gonna break something!
dr180421 -- I had donuts this morning... - Pizza this afternoon... - And ice cream this evening! - All in one day?? That's known as a Ralph Drabble Hattrick!
dr180422 -- Not again! Z - Sorry, cat, but that's MY chair! - - - zzyzx - - - It's getting crowded out here!
dr180423 -- HA! - What makes you think you're a real hockey player, li'l dude? -
dr180424 -- BARK BARK BARK BARK BARK - Quiet, Wally! I need to concentrate! - I'm trying to research our family tree! - In our family tree, I'm probably the bark!
dr180425 -- Is that a flea collar? No. - It's a DOG collar! - I'm wearing a flea collar! - I'd hate to see the flea!
dr180426 -- Just one quart of milk? Would you like a bag? - No thanks. I hate paying for things that used to be free. - I understand. We're just trying to cut down on our paper consumption. - Don't forget your receipt!
dr180427 -- MY NEW COUCH PILLOWS! - They obviously weren't dumbdog-proof! Please, no need to thank me!
dr180428 -- Wait, where are my keys? - - Oh, here they are! - I have magic cargo pants. I put things in one pocket and find them in another!
dr180429 -- Honeybunch says I don't put enough effort into picking out her birthday cards. - She says I pay too much attention to how the card looks, and not enough attention to what it says on the inside. - Here's a pretty one! "Happy Birthday to my
dr180429 -- Dear Sweet Wife." Perfect! - But, wait...I better check what it says on the inside! - "Please remove cellophane wrap before putting into envelope." - Sure, that's a winner!
dr180430 -- Dad, there's a company that can determine your ancestry if you send them a saliva sample! - I know. I've already done it! - Really? Did you learn anything interesting? - I'm related to famous amos and little Debbie!
dr180501 -- - - - At some point, our walk-in closet became a toss-in closet!

dr180727 -- Well, it's time for me to go take the wedding pictures! - I'm so excited! I can't believe I'm a professional photographer! - I hope I have everything! Just don't forget your camera! - CAMERA??
dr180728 -- Back home at last! Well, it was a successful trip to Hawaii, Ralph! I got a new camera, and the wedding pictures turned out great! Yeah, and I never saw that girl who rescued me 40 years ago. That would've been embarrassing! - Thanks for

dr180806 -- - - Leonard blinked! Norman wins the Shy Person's Stare Contest!
dr180807 -- Before the baseball game starts, they always show a stadium evacuation plan for when the crowd has to leave in a hurry! - Does that ever happen? Yeah, when there's a three-run lead in the seventh inning!

dr180818 -- I must admit, Norman, I liked going to the car wash with you! - But, was it really an accident that you opened the moonroof and let all the water in, or did you just do that to cheer me up? - Echo, you don't really think I'm that dumb, do
dr180818 -- you? - Well...yeah. Dad's gonna kill me!

dr180905 -- PIZZA You're so weird! - I can't believe you don't like pineapple on your pizza! There's a reason Italy and Hawaii are on different sides of the world!

dr180907 -- SUPERMARKET But the sign said those sodas were 88c per bottle! - You should've read the fine print! It says "Must by five or more." - You should have made the print larger so people can read it! - Why would we want to do that?
dr180908 -- SUPERMARKET Well, I hope you're happy! Your misleading sign got me to buy all this soda! - I've shopped at this supermarket for 25 years! I've never felt like they cheated me until today! - Now now, Ralph...don't be silly! - We've been
dr180908 -- cheating you for years! You've just never noticed!
dr180909 -- Follow me, Wally! I want to show you a magic trick! - I'm going to stand in a doorway and lift up this blanket... - And I'll disappear! I've seen this trick baffle dogs all over the Internet! - When I drop the blanket, I'll be gone! - I'm

dr180910 -- Anyone you'd like me to bark at? Is it time to eat yet? - Wanna play ball? Where's the cat? Wanna go for a walk? - Why do dogs sit and stare at you like that? Wanna play with a sock? Is it time to eat yet?
dr180911 -- I'm telling you, honeybunch, we're getting old? - We ARE NOT! - I'm sure lots of young couples spend their date night at All-Mart checking their blood pressure.

dr181118 -- Supermarket The last time Mom will send Ralph and Norman to buy milk... I found the milk, dad! - Great! Be sure to check the expiration date! - It expires on November 25th. - Check the other containers to see if any have a better expiration

dr190123 -- You know the phrase "go the extra mile"? Yes. - Why would anyone do that? Then you'd be a mile past where you were going! - Then you'd have to turn around and go back a mile. It would waste gas. - DANG! A golf course is not the place to
dr190123 -- overthink things.

dr190316 -- embarrassed than anyone!
dr190317 -- Isn't it wonderful to be on a cruise, Ralph? Yes, but we're not docking at any ports today. - What's there to do all day long? Well, there's an art show at ten... - Oh, that sounds fun! And a dance class at noon. - Wow! There's a gallery tour

dr190404 -- I think it's important to write down our thoughts and experiences regularly... - So I've encouraged each of our children to keep a log! - I think you need to explain it a little better to Norman!
dr190405 -- Alexander, play some classical music! - Alexander, don't you dare! Play country music! - Alexander, play classical! Alexander, don't listen to her! Play country! - Alexander, CLASSICAL! Alexander, COUNTRY! Hey, Google...help!

dr190406 -- the night!
dr190407 -- Sit up, Wally! - Good boy! - Spin around! - Good boy! - Shake hands! - Good boy! - I've got him trained to give me a snack every time I do a trick! I'll never be that hungry!
dr190408 -- Kids, we're going to visit our uncle Mike! - He used to be a businessman, but he gave it all up and moved to the desert to raise alpacas! - Why? That's a good question. - Why would anyone go to the desert to visit him? That's an even better
dr190408 -- question!
dr190409 -- I think this is Uncle Mike's Alpaca Ranch! - AAAUGHH!! - GAAAAHH!!! - AAAHHH!! Oh, hi, uncle Mike!
dr190410 -- Welcome to my alpaca ranch! It's nice to see you again, uncle Mike! - Although you look a little different! - I guess that's what happens when you spend so much time with alpacas! - You look different too! He's starting to resemble our TV
dr190410 -- remote.
dr190411 -- Alpacas are highly intelligent animals. They are similar to, and often confused with the llama! - What llama? Wait, we're not llamas? MOST of them are intelligent!
dr190412 -- Alpacas make a variety of sounds, including humming! - They hum when they are happy, worried, curious or cautious. - * * * Or when they've got a song stuck in their mind. That explains why I keep hearing "It's a small world."
dr190413 -- Hey, I just read an interesting fact about alpacas! - They spit when they find something irritating! - And they can spit up to ten feet! Make it eleven!

dr190429 -- - - The answer is eleven. What was the question? - How many CVS receipts does it take to circle the moon and back?
dr190430 -- - It's not raining anymore! - Oh, OK... - My umbrella has a sunroof!
dr190501 -- Would you like me to give you a ride home, Norman? - That would be great, Echo! - Just remember to keep your hands and arms inside the car! - Sorry. I got a job at the amusement park, and I'm already losing my mind!
dr190502 -- I just got a job as a ride operator at the amusement park, and I'm already losing my mind! - Every day I'm responsible for the safety of thousands of people! - Oh, well...here's my car! - Before you get in, let's make sure you meet the height

dr190507 -- Wally is fast! - But not as fast as Oogie! And I'm only jogging!
dr190508 -- What now, Wally? - Is it time for dinner? - You just had breakfast 30 seconds ago! - This is going to be a long day!

dr190516 -- - Wow, that was the nicest bathroom I've ever seen on a golf course! - I think that was someone's condo!
dr190517 -- WHACK! - That was almost a perfect drive! - If only it had gone a little bit farther and straighter, and hadn't hit a tree and bounced into a river! So close.
dr190518 -- What a lousy day on the golf course! - I lost two dozen golf balls! - You also lost your golf bag and all of your clubs! Yeah, maybe I should go back and fish 'em out of the lake!
dr190519 -- Coming to the amusement park just isn't the same anymore. - It used to be for kids. - Now it's the adults who wear funny hats and shirts. They even get MARRIED here! - Tickets, parking, food, and souvenir prices have all skyrocketed, and yet
dr190519 -- it's more crowded here than ever! - It doesn't matter how long the lines get, nobody seems to mind! - People are so in love with this place, it's kind of weird! - Does this mean you no longer want us to scatter your ashes over the log edge?

dr190526 -- Why can't I get this sunscreen spray bottle to work? - It has a locking cap. You have to twist it! - I still can't get it to work! Here. - Why would sunscreen need a locking cap anyway? - Is our society so corrupt that we need to LOCK UP our
dr190526 -- SUNSCREEN?? - Are we afraid of sunscreen bandits? - Is there a mad sunscreen sprayer on the loose?? What else should have a lock on it? Deodorant? Lip balm?? - Try to get some sleep now, Ralph! Maybe they should put a little keypad on the
dr190526 -- bottle so we can enter our sunscreen passcode!

dr190601 -- I'm all out of peanuts, dad! - Good job, Norm! You#re turning into quite a salesman! - See how much easier it is when you toss the peanuts and pass the money down the aisle? - Money?
dr190602 -- PEANUTS HERE! I'LL TAKE ONE! - Just pass the money down the aisle! - - ? - - - - - Here you go! - Next time, pass it down the OTHER way!
dr190603 -- Don't be lazy, Norm. - If you want to climb the ladder of success... - All it takes is a little energy! - Isn't there any escalator of success?

dr190605 -- ? - - Excuse me. This one is mine! - If this is a memory pillow, how come it's always on the wrong side of the bed?
dr190606 -- In order to weigh you, Wally, we have to weigh us together! - Hmm...we've gained a little weight. - I may have to put you on a diet! - Hopefully, it was just his McFlurry!

dr200207 -- romantic, you can't beat the drive-thru car wash!
dr200208 -- MALL Echo suggested we meet at the food court! - We'll grab a bite to eat, walk around and then see a movie! - Something tells me this will be a night to remember! - Hello, Norman. WENDY!!
dr200209 -- I hate these plastic produce bags! - After you tear one off, you can never open it! - Everyone has to lick their fingers to get a grip! - And then they touch all the produce! - It's disgusting! - And that's why I never eat any fruits or

dr200211 -- MALL Wendy, not to be rude, but I'm meeting someone in just a minute! - Don't worry. This won't take long. - I've been thinking... - Where do I begin? How about someplace else?
dr200212 -- Norman, I know I haven't always been nice to you. That's OK. Bye! - I realize that I need to be a better person. OK, bye! - My new year's resolution is to be nicer. OK, bye. - so I ask you for forgiveness. You got it! Bye!

dr200214 -- Norman! Why were you kissing that girl?? - I thought you were shy, but I guess I was wrong! Well, you can kiss your date goodbye!! - - So, what are YOU doing tonight? Sorry, I have plans.
dr200215 -- Well, this was the worst Valentine's Day ever! - I thought nothing could be worse than not having a date on Valentine's Day, but there IS something worse. - Having my date walk out on me before it even starts! - At least I had a date before I
dr200215 -- didn't have a date! In a sense, that's progress!
dr200216 -- - - chirp! - - chirp! - - chirp! Let's split up! Finding the chirping smoke alarm is a group effort!
dr200217 -- My Valentine's date was a complete disaster. - I'm the biggest loser on earth! Son, you're not the biggest loser on... - Wait, I missed Valentine's Day?? - Do you have any belated Valentine's cards?
dr200218 -- I'm sorry your Valentine's date didn't work out, son. - Let me tell you a story: Long before I met your mom, I took a date to an expensive Valentine's day dinner... - I found out that afterwards, she went out for ice cream with another guy! -
dr200218 -- In other words, she desserted me!
dr200219 -- Everything went wrong for me on Valentine's Day, dad. - It was like I got thrown under a bus! I've been under more buses than a Greyhound mechanic! - Now I'm in the doghouse! I've been in the doghouse more often than Lassie! - You're not
dr200219 -- helping. Keep going! I've got a million of these!
dr200220 -- Echo, there's a reasonable explanation for what you saw... - Wendy made a New Year's resolution to be nicer to people, so she kissed me! That's all there was to it! - - She'd never believe me! Tell her I was Liam Helmsworth and that you get
dr200220 -- mixed up a lot!
dr200221 -- I don't even know what to say to Echo! Speak from the heart! Pretend she's here listening! - I'd tell her she's the only one I wanted to spend Valentine's Day with! It was all a big misunderstanding! - Then I'd beg for her forgiveness because
dr200221 -- she's my favorite person in the world! - Well, OK! As long as you put it that way!
dr200222 -- Thanks for forgiving me, Echo! It was just a big mix-up! - I didn't kiss Wendy, she kissed me! - Although, I have to admit, it wasn't exactly terrible! Besides... - Hey, where did she go? I hung up before you could put your foot into your
dr200222 -- mouth.
dr200223 -- WALLY! - No, NO! - HEY! - STOP! - SCAT! - DOWN! - Hello, wacky Wally-Woo! - I'm known by many different names around here!

dr200225 -- Which club should I use... - My three-wood or my nine-iron? - Decisions, decisions... - I don't know why I have so many clubs in my bag. I can only hit two of them!
dr200226 -- - - YES! - Every once in a while, I find an old snack in my golf bag!
dr200227 -- - - OK, it's been two minutes! I don't understand the concept of intermittent fasting, but I'm willing to give it a try!
dr200228 -- *!!*@!*! ...Sigh... - **!!* As long as I have to listen to your movie, I might as well watch it, too!
dr200229 -- It's been a long, cold winter, but at last I can finally say... - Baseball Opening Day is THIS MONTH! - Sorry, it's still February. - Whoever invented leap year was not a baseball fan!

dr200302 -- Norm, Wally needs to go outside. I don't want him to get wet, so take an umbrella! - I'm not going to stand in the rain holding an umbrella over the dog! Suit yourself! - sniff sniff
dr200303 -- I'm on a diet, so I won't go inside the donut shop... - I'll just stick my head in the door and enjoy the aroma! - - That must have taken a lot of willpower! Mmmmmm!
dr200304 -- - Is it my imagination, or do couch pillows seem to multiply?
dr200305 -- Wally! We're home! - Wally! - It's never a good thing when your dog is hiding! YIKES! WHAT HAPPENED IN THERE?!

dr200310 -- - Yikes! - Every time I look at myself in the mirror, I look a year older! - Maybe that's because I only look in the mirror once a year!
dr200311 -- I can't find my phone! - Call it! - HEY, PHONE!! - ...Sigh...I meant call it from another phone! No one understands my wonderful sense of humor!
dr200312 -- Isn't it nice to have dinner alone in a restaurant, Ralph? - No kids...no TV... - No sad doggie eyes watching your every bite... - They're always with me in spirit!
dr200313 -- A box! - Cats like boxes! - ROWF! - So do dogs!
dr200314 -- - ROWF! - - It's more fun to startle a cat outside because there's no ceiling!
dr200315 -- Since I ate that big piece of pie, I think I'd better go take a walk! - How far will you walk? Around the block a couple of times! - Well, maybe just once around. - Or maybe just around the Cul-de-Sac. - Or maybe I'll just walk up and down
dr200315 -- the sidewalk a little. - Maybe I'll just walk into the kitchen and get another piece of pie! Now THOSE walk can add up!
dr200316 -- Oh, cool! There's a baseball movie on TV tonight! - At least I think it's a baseball movie. What's it called? - "Bang the Drum Slowly". - Son, if that's not a baseball movie, I don't know what is!

dr200828 -- YAWN! - - What the... - Hey, I don't know where you've been!
dr200829 -- I can't believe summer is almost over. Don't worry. It's 2020. Anything can happen. - What do you men? - They delayed baseball season. Maybe they delay fall! Let's hope!
dr200830 -- - HONK! - - BEEP BEEP!! - - HONK! - It's nice to have friends, but I wish they wouldn't honk at me when I take a walk!
dr200831 -- knock knock knock - Hmmm...the dog inside usually barks his head off when I knock at the door! - It's hard to bark when you're stuck inside a pair of sweatpants!
dr200901 -- Shake hands, Wally! - - Oh, yeah...I forgot. - Elbow bump!
dr200902 -- Badger Free Zone Why do we have so many pillows on the couch, honeybunch? - I think they're pretty... - When they're spaced properly! I think we need a few more!
dr200903 -- I love getting out for a drive! - There's nothing like the freedom of the open road! - chirp! - No one is ever free when they're included in a group text! chirp! chirp! chirp! chirp! chirp!
dr200904 -- I've been having insomnia lately. - Since I can't sleep, I drive down to the all-night donut shop, and then stop at the 24-hour shake shop. - Gee, that's too bad! - What are you taking for the insomnia? Caffeine.
dr200905 -- Maybe some used tissues... - Or whatever's in the garbage pail... - Or the cumbs between the couch cushions... - Never ask Wally what he wants for dinner! Dog's food OK, too!
dr200906 -- I just love Sunday walks in September! - This IS a Sunday in September, is it? Who knows? The past six months have been a blur! - It seems like may. Didn't baseball just start? Good question. I'll check my smartphone!
dr200907 -- - There. - You left the cooler in the car! - I'm finally beginning to understand why today is called Labor Day!
dr200908 -- HELLO! Hello, my name is Penny and I live down the street and I have a brother named Norman and a brother named Patrick and a dog named Wally and I'm in kindergarten and my favorite color is yellow and I'm sorry that I picked flowers from
dr200908 -- your garden and I like to play soccer and I have a friend named Kendall and my very favorite thing to have for lunch is mac and cheese! - Well? Did you apologize for picking their flowers? Yup!
dr200909 -- Here's your ticket. - Nice try, though! - How come it's OK to have a cardboard person in a baseball stadium, but not in a carpool lane?
dr200910 -- Wow! - I remember when you hair was so thick, it was hard to pull a comb through! - Now the comb just glides across your scalp. - I'll sure be glad when I can go back to a real barber!
dr200911 -- bzzzzz! - - - If flies are so dumb, how come they all recognize a swatter?
dr200912 -- - I have to go to the bathroom. - Don't move or they'll throw us out of the stadium!
dr200913 -- Goodbye, Summer. I always hate to deflate the pool! It was hard work blowing it up! - I wish I could find another way to make use of it in the fall. - -
dr200914 -- Norman, are you gaining weight? Probably. - There's a girl who works at the Drive-Thru, and I think she's cute, so I keep going back! - She works at the shake and ice cream place that looks like an igloo. What's her name? - Frosti! Figures.
dr200915 -- There's a girl who works at the drive-thru shake place. Her name is Frosti! - She's really pretty! I'm trying to get the nerve to ask her out. I thought liked ECHO! - I do, but we have nothing in common! - What don't you have in common?! I
dr200915 -- like plain Cap'n Crunch, and she likes Crunch Berries!
dr200916 -- THE SHAKES I'd like a chocolate shake, please! - Here's your...hey, wait! - Haven't you driven through here about ten times tonight? - She noticed me!!
dr200917 -- I did it! I asked the girl at the Shake Place for a date! She'll meet me after work! I'm so excited! - I'm surprised she said yes right away! She's the most beautiful girl I've ever seen! - Although, I've never actually seen her without a
dr200917 -- mask! But I'm sure she's...I assume she's... - HOW DO I GET OUT OF THIS?? Can we all come and watch?
dr200918 -- I'm psyched out! I just realized Frosti and I have never seen each other without masks! - I just hope I don't flee in terror when she takes it off! - Here are your shakes! Thanks! - AAKK!
dr200919 -- Time for a walk, Wally! A walk?? - I don't want to go for a walk! I'm comfortable! Leave me alone! - I'll play dead! - Fine. We'll give your dinner to the cat. I'm alive!!
dr200920 -- OOOOOHH! Why oh why did I eat four humongous buttermilk bars? - WHY OH WHY OH WHY OH WHY OH WHY OH WHY OH WHY OH WHY OH WHY OH WHY OH WHY?? - I can't finish this. So you want it? Sure!
dr200921 -- - Why are you staring at me? - It's a commercial!
dr200922 -- CRUMPLE CRUMPLE - - RIP! RIP! SHRED! - As long as we have Wally, we never need an alarm system or a shredder! Grrr!
dr200923 -- YES! - For once, the scale gives me good news! - Actually, doesn't "Lo" mean it needs new batteries? Whatever! I'm going to have some ice cream!
dr200924 -- Good morning! - Happy Saturday! - Today is Thursday. - Every day is Saturday to a dog!
dr200925 -- Please give me one! - KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! - Someone's at the door. Aren't you going to bark your head off? - I'm not good at multitasking.
dr200926 -- - - It's so nice to have a dessert bar!
dr200927 -- putt! - NO!! - WHY? WHY? WHY??!! - DANG! - FLING! - - Ready to tee off, dad? Yeah, I think I'm all warmed up now! PRACTICE GREEN
dr200928 -- This burger restaurant always puts a little message on the bottom of their cups! They do? - Oh, I see it!
dr200929 -- What an awful day on the golf course! I'm in the rough again! - What club should I use? - Either your 3-wood or your 4-iron. Why? - Those are the only clubs left in your bag. Maybe I should dive in the lake and retrieve my wedge!
dr200930 -- - Do I even want to know what you did? WALLY!
dr201001 -- skattle skattle skattle - - I know you can't wait to jump into a pile of leaves, but be patient! ?
dr201002 -- Oh boy! I get to be the first one to jump into that pile of leaves! - POOMF!
dr201003 -- What a great feeling to know that I can sleep in this morning! 7:00 - - WHAT?! - I was just checking to see if I needed to call 911! I would if I were you!
dr201004 -- I FOUND THE VACUUM, HONEYBUNCH!
dr201005 -- Cartoonists hate to draw leaves. - How come? - It takes forever. - Fortunately, they have nothing else to do!
dr201006 -- If leaves are so hard to draw, why do cartoonists even draw them? - Guilt. They feel bad that their job is usually so much fun. - And actually, leaves aren't even the hardest things for cartoonists to draw. What's harder? - Soccer balls!
dr201007 -- - SNAP! - Cleaning up leaves is easy with my new artificial lawn!
dr201008 -- OK, I think I've got this figured out... - To get in shape, I need to take 10,000 steps per day. - Now, it's eleven steps from the couch to the refrigerator... - Oh, for heaven sakes! Just hear me out!
dr201009 -- Candy corn? - Why would you fill our candy dish with THAT?? - I hate candy corn! - And therefore, I don't have to refill it every 30 seconds!
dr201010 -- I've hated candy corn for as long as I can remember. - Why does she fill the candy dish with it every year? - - Uh-oh. I see you've developed a taste!
dr201011 -- What's up with THAT guy??  Hey! Dave is growing a beard! It doesn't help! Whoa, look at Fred's tie! He must shop at the Dollar Store! - Bill needs a haircut! You don't look hot either, Ralph! Ralph, remember to "mute" yourself when you join
dr201011 -- Zoom Church!
dr201012 -- Why do you always follow me around? - Because I love you! - And maybe a little bit because I'm hungry! - Mostly because I'm hungry!
dr201013 -- ...and that's the story of how I won the "Best Attitude" award in tee-ball! - Wow. - There's never a dull moment with you, Norman. - The dullness just goes on and on! Thanks!
dr201014 -- - bink! - bink! bink! - Done! Good job with the eye drops, Norm.
dr201015 -- HALLOWEEN CANDY Hmm... - The Halloween candy is pretty picked over! - I know, Ralph! - You've been buying it up since August! Leave some for the rest of us!
dr202016 -- - "Pumpkinhole."
dr201017 -- WHIFF! - WHIFF WHIFF WHIFF! - ? - A box of tissues doesn't go as far as it used to!
dr201018 -- Ralph, will you take your clean shirts up to our room next time you go upstairs? - Sure! - - - Ahem! - Or I can just take them up right now! Try to be a little more swift on the uptake!
dr201019 -- Whoops! - I just missed my turn-off! - YES! - Whenever I make a driving mistake, I'm always relieved when I'm alone in the car!
dr201020 -- For Halloween, we should decorate our house to look haunted. - Spiders, cobwebs, scary noises, creaky doors. - Neglected front yard, foreboding ambience... - So, what should we do differently? That's the beauty! We're practically there!
dr201021 -- I love going to the Pumpkin Patch! Me too! Pumpkin City --> Welcome! - Somehow it feels different this year! I wonder why. - Maybe it's the cardboard pumpkins!
dr201022 -- I need to find a way to get candy to the socially distant trick-or-treaters this year! Hold your bag out, Morm! - PSSHEEW! BOP! - Maybe we shouldn't give out hard candy. OUCH! **
dr201023 -- - - - Thanks! I needed that!
dr201024 -- ROWF ROWF ROWF! - ROWF ROWF ROWF ROWF! - -
dr201025 -- KNOCK KNOCK - Oh no! Zombies, goblins and ghouls at my door! - What do you want with me NOW?? - TRICK Or TREAT!! - Oh, it's just Halloween?? What a relief!! - I thougt it was just another ordinary day in the year 2020!
dr201026 -- Don't you just love the colors of autumn, Ralph? - Huh? Oh yeah, sure! - You're such a party-pooper! - The only colors of autumn I'm interested in are on candy wrappers.
dr201027 -- Which foot do you kick with, Penny? - I kick with both of my feet! - Really? That's cool! - I run with both feet too!
dr201028 -- DING DONG! - Well, I guess I should have expected this... - Cardboard Trick-or-treaters!
dr201029 -- What's so scary about THAT jack-o'-lantern? - ROWF ROWF ROWF!
dr201030 -- Take some candy out to the trick-or-treaters, Wally! - - On second thought... - WALLY
dr201031 -- - WHACK! - Thanks, Mr. Drabble!
dr201101 -- He's playing soccer, mother! - He'll be excited to know you're watching his game on my phone! - Patrick, look! Grandma is watching you play soccer! - Hi, Patrick! What? - Oh, hi, Grandma! - GOOOOOOOOOAAALLL!! OK, that's enough! Wait! I want
dr201101 -- to tell him about my new kitty!
dr201102 -- When I was a kid, I had nightmares that our old Jack-o'-Lanterns would climb out of the trash can and return to haunt us! - What a scaredy-cat I was! - 
dr201103 -- Why are you piling things on top of the garbage can? - I just threw out our Jack-o'-Lantern, and I don't want it to come back and haunt us! - According to legend, the Abominable Pumpkinman rises out of the garbage can to haunt us until
dr201103 -- Thanksgiving! - Oh, well, that's only a month! Wait, American Thanksgiving or Canadian?
dr201104 -- Ralph, are you really afraid that our old Jach-o'-Lantern will rise up out of our trash can, call irself "The Abominable Pumpkinman", and return to haunt us?? -Yes! Why?? - It's *2020*! Oh, yeah, huh! LOCK THE DOORS!
dr201105 -- Did you hear a noise outside? No, Ralph. Calm down! - Old Jack-o'-Lanterns do not escape from trash cans and return to haunt people. - Besides, if Wally saw a thing like that, he'd bark and protect us! - Right, Wally? He's shivering under the
dr201105 -- covers!
dr201106 -- There's only one way to be sure our old Jack-o'-Lantern doesn't turn into the abominable pumpkinman... - I'm going to take it out of the trash can and smash it! - IT'S GONE! - OOOOOOO
dr201107 -- RUN! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA - Hey, I recognize that laugh! - STEINBAUER!! Top o' the evening, Ralph!
dr201108 -- Look, Ralph! I installed a doorbell camera! - Whenever someone comes to our door, I can see them on my phone! - I can even talk to them! That's great! - - Hey, honeybunch! - Honeybunch? DING DONG! Yes? - What's for dinner? I already regret
dr201108 -- this!
dr201109 -- I overheard you talking to yourself! I couldn't resist playing a prank! - You actually thought your old pumpkin would escape from your trash can and return to haunt you?? HA! - What a scaredy-cat you are, Ralph! I'm going inside to tell my
dr201109 -- wife! - GAAAAAAAAHHH!!
dr201110 -- Sweet! I found some Halloween candy under the cushions! - 3-SECOND RULE! - It's probably been there for at least a week! - 604,800-SECOND RULE!
dr201111 -- WALLY shiver shiver shiver - I said it was VETERANS Day, not VETERINARIANS Day!
dr201112 -- I'm back from the store! Did you buy dog food? - I don't see any dog food! - You didn't eat it all on the way home, did you??
dr201113 -- Whoa! Thisd milk is expired! - It's way past the expiration date! - Why is it still in the refrigerator? - It's so old, everyone's probably afraid to dump it out!
dr201114 -- I figure it's OK to eat this when I'm dieting because there are 50 calories in a donut. - That's incorrect. - A donut has *250* calories! - *50* is in *250*!
dr201115 -- Ralph, according to my tracking app, you stopped at the donut shop on your way home. - I told you dinner would be ready! Did you really stop there? - Yesterday, my tracking app said you were in the middle of the lake! - Technology is weird.
dr201115 -- Obviously you weren't in the lake! I wonder why it said you were! Haha! - Kind of a coincidence! Sigh... - I don't think you really answered the question. I should've gone into politics!
dr201116 -- Eat, sleep, bark... - Eat, sleep, bark. - There must be more to life. - But so far, so good!
dr201117 -- thanks! I'll pick up our order in 20 minutes! - One of the few good things to come from the shutdown is curbside pick-up. - I've known about it for years! sniff sniff!
dr201118 -- Wallet...phone... - Hand sanitizer...lip balm...pen... - Aha! My keys! - Why do you stuff everything into ONE POCKET?? Saves time!
dr201119 -- Six-thirty. - Time to get up! scratch scratch - You too, Wally! It's chilly. I'll wait here until breakfast is ready.
dr201120 -- Ooh! Hold still! - snip! snip! snip! - There! I missed a spot last week! - My wife's haircuts go on for days!
dr201121 -- So nice of them to buy me a ramp. - I think I need a ramp for my ramp!
dr201122 -- CHIRP CHIRP! - - - CHIRP CHIRP! - - - CHIRP CHIRP! Sigh... - Sometimes I think using a family group text is silly. - Especially when they're all in the same room!
dr201123 -- Charlie Chaplin said, " love to walk in the rain so no one can see my tears." - I can relate to that! - Why? Are you sad? No, I sweat a lot!
dr201124 -- It's never too early to start decorating. - Do you mind if I start decorating for Christmas, Ralph? - You ALREADY decorated for Christmas! - These decorations are for Christmas 2021!
dr201125 -- - - Did you buy a turkey yet? Yes. - Darn! I married one, too!
dr201126 -- What could be better then being at the table for Thanksgiving dinner? - Being UNDER the table for Thanksgiving dinner! Oops! I spilled again!
dr201127 -- OK, kids! Time to go! Don't forget your masks! Why do we have to wear them just to go for a walk? - Because I said so! We do whatever mom sayw! - By the way, Ralph, your mask looks different! Who used up my light blue face paint? Shhhh!
dr201128 -- Happy Thanksgiving - - - At least we don't have an Arbor Day Flag!
dr201129 -- skattle skattle skattle - Wanna play ball, Wally? wab wag wag - Hey! skattle skattle skattle - wag wag wag - Hey! skattle skattle skattle - wag wag wag - Hey! skattle skattle skattle - What kind of game was that?? All I know is, I won!
dr201130 -- I bought a Christmas tree, honeybunch! - It's an artificial tree that comes fully decorated! Seriously? - What could be more lazy than getting a predecorated tree? - How about leaving it in the box?
dr201201 -- Empty Water Bottle - Wrapping Paper Tube - Old Sock - It's time to start thinking of my Christmas list!
dr201202 -- I knew we'd eventually find a use for all our face masks, honeybunch! - No.
dr201203 -- KNOCK KNOCK! ? - You were right, I'm going to need help with the lights!
dr201204 -- A used tissue. - An old tennis ball. - A cushion insole. - Still working on your Christmas list? I may need a bigger stocking.
dr201205 -- Suppertime, Wally! - skattle skattle skattle - How about if I put it in your dish? I'm just trying to streamline the process!
dr201206 -- - - - YES!! GO! GO! GO! - TOUCHDOWN!! - WE'RE NUMBER ONE! WE'RE NUMBER... - - I hate it when I look up from my phone, see somebody score a touchdown, and then realize they're just showing a highlight clip!

dr201208 -- WALLY KNOCK KNOCK! - ROWF ROWF ROWF ROWF ROWF! - Another package? Thanks! - 'tis the season! I'm pretty sure it's badger season!
dr201209 -- "Silent Night". "Grandma got run over by a reindeer". - I'm telling you the world's greatest Christmas song is "Silent Night". - Nope, its "Grandma got run over by a reindeer". Sigh... - Some people just shouldn't argue with each other!
dr201210 -- I really miss holiday shopping at the mall. - The music, the chaos, the elaborate decorations... - How is that any different from our living room? *
dr201211 -- * And A Partridge in a Pear Tree! * Merry Christmas, Drabble Family! - Thank you for the song and cookies! - Next year, just skip the song! Shhh!
dr201212 -- MALL Well, I guess that was a failure, mom! - It was worth a try. - I thought it would be fun to get a picture of Wally with Santa. - Oh, well... At least now we all know his beard's not real!
dr201213 -- See you after work, honeybunch! For dinner tonight, let's go get a hamburger! - We'll go to that new burger place that you like! Great! - - - - - - I change dmy mind. We're having spinach casserole! * - I hate it when he comes home grumpy!
dr201214 -- We've put up all our decorations, but it still doesn't feel like Christmas! - What am I forgetting? - Oh, yeah! - Much better!
dr201215 -- YAWN! - - Dang! - I hate it when I'm all ready to go to bed, and it's only 7:45!

dr201222 -- Oh boy! I smell  gingerbread! - I LOVE gingerbread! - There's nothing like the aroma of freshly baked gingerbread! - Except for a recently purchased scented candle!
dr201223 -- ...and Santa will slide down the chimney with his bag of toys! - Why does he slide down the cimney? I know why... - If he knocked on a door with a dachshund inside, it would no longer be a silent night!
dr201224 -- WALLY Hello, Wally. It's just me, Santa. Z - I'll be very quiet and I won't wake you up. ZZYZX - Knock on wood! - ROWF ROWF ROWF ROWF ROWF Why did I say "Knock"??

dr210707 -- I KNOW YOU'RE HIDING SOMEWHERE, WALLY! - COME ON, WE NEED TO GO! - YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE VET! - Couldn't we just do it on Zoom?
