    so you've found novata.
    i'm not gonna explain what it is; that would ruin the fun.
    i'll explain a few other things, though:


    novata was created by sugarfi originally, but is open to the public - anyone can contribute


    do you have a page you want to add?
    send a pr to <a href="https://github.com/sugarfi/novata">this github repo</a>.
    keep a few things in mind:
    1. DO NOT EDIT PAGES OTHER THAN YOUR OWN. if you made a page, you can edit it. if you didn't, hands off.
    2. cw things effectively: this includes things like food.


    that's all. have fun on this corner of the internet.
