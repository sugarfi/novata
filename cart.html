        cartesianism. the belief that anything can be worked out simply by deductive reasoning,
        with enough time.

        i don't see it that way. i see it as a useful tool, for figuring out what you already know;
        you start from what you know you know, and deduce forward (mk√¶) from that, and find out things
        you didn't know you knew. you aren't getting any new information; in that absence of external
        input, yo ucan't learn anything. you already knew the knowledge, but you're revealing it to yourself.
