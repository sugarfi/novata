        brad and ryan were in a faceoff against their mortal enemies yvette and chad.
        they each pulled out a gun and had their fingers on the triggers. 'so,' said
        brad, 'it has come to t' he was interrupted by yvette shooting at him. ryan
        bravely jumped in front of him to catch the bullet and save his friend.
        however, bullets moving as fast as they do and ryan having terrible reflexes,
        the bullet caught brad and he died. chad proceeded to shoot
        ryan in a similar manner.
