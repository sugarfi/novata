    <h1>my mama always said, life is like a box of chocolates</h1>
    <p>
        it's either painfully small and you want more, or it's way too
        large and you get full halfway through but have to finish it
        anyway. you're not sure what any of the chocolates taste like, and
        every second you spend looking at the box to find out is a second
        wasted, the chocolates rotting, time running out to eat them before
        ants swarm them or someone comes and takes them from you. 
    </p>
    <p>
        people complain all the time about how some of the chocolates are terrible,
        and sometimes they're right. 
    </p>
    <p>
        you never really want a box of chocolates;
        when you get one, it's a pleasant surprise, i guess. it's not better
        or worse than anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
        there is no meaning to a box of chocolates. it's a box of chocolates. you eat it.
        if one person tries to tell you that a box of chocolates means something, you
        probably don't listen. when everyone tells you that, maybe you do.
    </p>
    <p>
        once the box of chocolates is done, the chocolates eaten, you must throw it out.
        it can't be recycled; it's made of plastic. the box will go to a landfill, or the ocean,
        where it will spend a long time rotting away, giving nothing to anybody. nobody
        cares about the box after the chocolates are gone.
    </p>
    <p>
        you can eat the chocolates however you want. you could eat your chocolates with your feet
        glued to the ceiling, hanging upside down. yet you don't. nobody eats chocolates that way;
        why bother? eating chocolates the normal way works perfectly fine.
    </p>
    <p>
        you have to eat the chocolates. if you don't, they'll go bad, or they'll be thrown away.
        or someone else will take them. at any point, someone else can come and with a simple motion
        of their hand steal your entire box of chocolates.
    </p>
    <p>
        the chocolates melt if you leave them out for too long.
