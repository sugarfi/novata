    <h1>why can't we choose what we want?</h1>
    <pre>
        this is not an explanation. this is an open-ended question.
        why can't we choose what we want? why can't we choose what we care about? why can't we choose what we like?
        after all, we are in control of ourselves and our minds
        aren't we?
        intrusive thoughts and the like would suggest not totally
        but like
        we can choose what we think about, for the most part
        why can't we choose what we feel about things?

        when we say 'i like [x]'
        'i want [x]'
        'i care about [x]'
        we speak like the 'i' is some seperate entity, kinda
        'oh, i know me! they want [x]!'
        or mybae not idk im not a linguist

       apparently things like good tasting food and bad tasting food evolved over the years so that
       stuff that hurts humans will taste bad

       so ig not being able to choose things like that is good for survival

       but how does not being able to choose what we want or carea bout help us, evolutionarily?

        if we're in a group of people, out in the wildneress, isn't it better to be able to just choose in an instant
        to care about them and be bonded with them so you have an urge to protect them, rather than have to spend time
        and bond with them to do that? isn't that better for survival?

        if we are in a situation where we could die, and doing x would be better, but we want do y, how is it better to
        not able to just make ourselves want to do x? did the human brain just for most of histyory not have a lot of
        scenarios wshere what we wanted was not congruent with what we nmeeded to survive?

        once again, no fucking clue. not a historian, not a neurologist.






         but if wanting smth is in our brains, that implies *it* helped somewhere , doesn't it? or jsut that it didn't hurt?
