            i try so hard to believe
            i believe the only way i can
            and what do i believe?
            youre sure thats the only wondering if i ever did
            im careful what i want to know
            i never go too far
            youre sure its the only one, this second nature
            make this it all, always it before i
            sorry, every time
            cant i stay?
