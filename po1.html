    my arm is torn open im weeping i cant sing
    my universe is coming weeping
    </p>
    <p>
    bodys cold has had their fill
    the bed although youre ill
    only one ripples in the storm
    youre there have the brew
    </p>
    <p>
    im the only i watch the ripples
    </p>
    <p>
    you were so very special at the very end
    i wish i could save you somehow steal your glory
    </p>
    <p>
    the soft skin starts i fall in love
    when dreams made real and in the morning
    the orchid and i fall in love
    </p>
