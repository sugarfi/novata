    <h1>when you open a website you make assumptions.</h1>
    <p>
        you assume it will look a certain way and allow you to
        do certain things and respond in a certain way to those
        things.
    </p>
    <pre>
        what if a website didn't do those things?
    </pre>
    <hr/>
    <p>
        of course, one can't do too much - the web has restrictions, and for good reason
        we don't want to allow this sort of behavior</p>
    <pre>
        but what is allowed is enough to at least make someone a bit disconcerted, hopefully
    </pre>
    <p>
        and sometimes we are reminded of all the power a simple webpage has
