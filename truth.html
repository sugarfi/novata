        what is the meaning of life?
    </p>
    <p>
        the meaning of life is a sheet of crumpled paper, ripped at ana angle along the middle with many unintelligible words on it,
        scrawled in differnet colors on top of eachother.

        this is not a joke. no extra interpretation is needed. it is not a metaphor. it is simply the answer to this question.

        why? it is true because i make it so. belive me or don't. if you do, this becomes factl; that is the answer to the question
        'wht is the meaning of life', no strings attached.
