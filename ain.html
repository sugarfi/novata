<FONT SIZE="3">Autonomous Individuals Network (AIN)</FONT> has been established 
to push forward into the future with practical applications of functional and 
demystified magick, using all techniques available to consider whether it be pagan, 
tribal, ceremonial, modern, or un-charted. We believe in EVERYTHING and that all 
things ARE possible. We form our network on the foundation of <A HREF="/topy.net">Thee 
Temple of Psychick Youth (NorthAmerica)</A>, and all the history and knowlege 
that community has gathered since its creation in the 1980's, and we set our sites 
to new horizons..<BR><BR> With a focus on the manipulation of media as magickal 
tool in the new Aeon, AIN acts as an blueprint or map for the INDIVIDUAL to follow 
for building greater personal strength, insight, and network individuality. It 
is a process of individual and collective experimentation and research with no 
finite answers, dogmas or unchallengeable truths. It is for each to discover his 
or her own understanding of the questions that suggest themselves, and through 
that voyage of discovery to find their personal and true identity, the True Will, 
the FOCUSED POTENTIAL.</FONT></B></FONT></DIV><P><FONT SIZE="2"><B><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
are an organization of INDIVIDUALS dedicated to updating and de-mystifying religious 
thought. A community founded as network where trust, help, and sharing are key 
tools for better interaction as humans. We are also dedicated to creating a world 
where Individuals can be free to express themselves by whatever means they wish 
to. We wish to break Control at all levels. We experiment with whatever methods 
we can utilize to accomplish these goals - magick, technology, poetry, musick, 
whatever!</FONT></B></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2"><B><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
first steps towards change, we attempt to cultivate an awareness of the consequences 
of our thoughts and actions, and to direct our energies in constructive directions. 
All this is done on the understanding that our thoughts and behaviour form the 
interface between our lives and the lives of others, and their repercussions are 
therefore endlessly returning.</FONT></B></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2"><B><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Awareness 
is consequently a requirement for our personal and collective survival and evolution. 
Still, we recognise that awareness itself is dependent on information, communication, 
and personal commitment to ACTIVE involvment with The Network. Our work is subsequently 
practical and well...WORK! <BR><BR>Exchanging theories, models, and methods we 
have found useful to ourselves, we form a bond with others within this Network. 
There is EFFORT required to being ACTIVE. Thus we do not dictate, but rather focus 
on expanding the available possibilities through thee cross-fertilisation of suggestions, 
successes, and failures, and the promotion and propagation of our collective creative 
notions through multiple outlets simultaneously. And for us this is a full-time 
commitment, a continual process of being, an endless myriad of becomings, an ever 
expanding canvas on which to paint life upon.<BR><BR>interested to know more click
