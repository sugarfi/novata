    why would fucking somebodyt and having kids give my life meaning that isn't the part i dislike

    look at me saying 'dislike' instead of 'feel sad about'

    so funny

    ahhaajkfsdhfjksd

    there isn't really a way to 'escape the system'

    that makes me sound both like some spoiled little white brat (correct i suppose)

    robert smith did it ig

    granted he also had musical ability

    and it's not like he was uncommerical

    and im prob just idolizing anyway

    fuck esplling

    shiver and shake

    so pun

    wow i was hnt expewcting to have a lot ot write here byut this is fcoming surprisingly nicely

    shows my typing ability lol

    i wonder if everygbody feels things about music bc i sure dont

    i wonder what percentage odf people leave nay sort ofg legacy

    chances are any shit i do wioll be forgotten within a decade of my death

    thjats as nice thought

    fuck discord bots like do real sdev

    i cant be talkign i suppose

    this isnt what i meant to write about but erhn again that is the opoint
    and it isnt
    funny

    new nmo linebraks :O

    not gona respond

    i wonder how out of context and bizara this is

    i doubt this makes snse to anyone reading

    fun

    strangerly or maybe not i dont mind

    i wonder if i sghould just write a shit ton here or leave it at this

    trhis is kinda nice to do but i wonder iof tah t isnt placebo shit

    'well somebody else said that this is good for htem so it must be goof for me'

    why did i questiion my fucvking ereponse to that

    after sayign inm not asl
    sdfjklsdfl;sdf

    no stop that

    kinda ironic thats how i attempt to install confidence in myself
    'no stop that be more confident cut yourselkf some slack'

    'anyone else do this'

    ' or " who fuckign casrsklff fuck fuck fuck

    overesedx 10 kids

    really not being coherent rn
    'sorry i din't mean to'
    not letting jason downm
    is thath is name

    wow im faking bad memory
    impostor syndrome goes brrrrrrr

    wonder if publishing this is even a good idea
    well screw good ideas
    kjdfkjfgkjffjfjfjfjfjfjfjfjfjf twtttter

    'i uncovered a scheme from twitter

    this is kinda nice way to vent but aslso kinda not

    a void, filled if im lucky with some clone of me digging through the internet in a few years, isn't a good therapist

    reason 1-inf not to have kids: they won't be people i understand
    ajka
    me

    maintaining goth emo image while sitll having healthy platonic relationships:
    step 1. fuicvk yiou


    wow
    ŭaŭ

    wow i did a great job time to be proud
    by which i mean think of how i don't have reasons to do that
    wow that sounded sad

    dfsdfsdfsdfsdfsdfsdf
    &lt;/s&gt;

    i wonder if im self centered
    probably too much
    wonder if i can apply the same logic i applied to aceness to trhe rest of my state of mind
    that soret of thign would make the worlda better polace ngl


    not gonna let that stop my rabnt

    altho maybe itws dying naturally

    i shoulds leep

    weird how mcuh this resembles a normal conversation i suoppose that says smth
