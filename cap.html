    imagine you could put anything you wanted in storage for future generations to see
    well guess what? now you cAn!
    


    with the all new <h4>time</h4>capsule/<h4>inter</h4>net/<h4>ar</h4>t, all you have to
    do is produce some content and then it's there! forever!

    m,aybe someone in the future will find it and will think of how amazing it is that they found even just a small nugget or stuff
     relic from a nother time
     or maybe they won't
     maybe nobody will evber see or remember your content, and it will just sit, decaying, until it and all its possible viewers
    are gone
    but lets not think about that!!!! :D

    turns out content is harder than it looks... but you know what they say, every single fucking time you try again is the
    charm! inspirational, isn't it?

    does your content live up to your expectations? if not, call BOB from BOB'S LAWNMOWER CARE

    all with the power of <h4>time</h4>capsule/<h4>inter</h4>net/<h4>ar</h4>t !!!!
