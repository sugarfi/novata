returning to the question:
what is art?

im not going to bother with dictionary definitions. i would say what my definition of art is,
but im not really sure. so ill start with what it isn't:

it isn't the classical notion of just portraits of fat monarchs and weird animals. that's a limited,
eurocentric, ignorant view.

it isn't some boys-club of 'high art', composed of pianists, painters, and poets - that is excluding
things like graffiti as art for no good reason.

it isn't how its often portrayed in media, as some egotistical, overthinking, pompous asshole exerting
little to no effort and producing shit. if it was, stream of conciousness writing wouldn't be art.

this leaves a very broad playing field. but now i have a better idea of my definition:

expressing ones ideas in a new way.

i say 'new way' here, to mean a way one does not normally use. after all, one wouldn't say simply saying 'hello'
to someone is artful (or would they?). but, with this definition, spray-paintign the word 'hello' in letters only
viewable from an airplane on a herd of cows, would be art. sure, it doesn't really conform to a lot of notions,
but it's interesting as fuck, and what else does art really need to be?

another consequence of this definition is that art is different for every person, perhaps. if one talks all the time,
one's normal method of speech (not poetry, singing, etc.) would not be artful - if one almost never speaks, but occasionally
utters a few phrases, maybe it would be. so this way, people can define art for themselves: what's smth you don't normally do?

i might say that art is just about the ideas being artful. but that just leads to ranking of individual ideas, and that's not
good under any circumstances.

i've said 'artful' a lot here.

that's kinda of a circular definition, the way its used. what does it mean?

aaaaand now we're back at the original question.
i think perhaps im writign this definition  catering to the pompous asshole mentioned above, if that makes sense. so let's make this
definition broader, just for yuks - or perhaps for a bit more than that.

let's just say that art
is an idea.

when you think about it, it could make sense.

what is a piano piece if not the musician's ideas poured into notes and played on an instrument, both of those simply the ideas of
some other creator given physical form, relying on yet other ideas from other creators.

what is a piece of graffiti if not the artist's ideas written on a wall or a sidewalk? again, both of those, and the can of spray
paint used, expressions of other ideas of other ideas of other ideas.

the whole of society can be considered just stacks of these ideas, leading us to assume it is artful in itself. laws, money, govt,
however flawed we view them, we must consider them art.

to an extent, the whole world can be viewed this way. it is often said that objectivity, real hard facts, does not exist: only
collective subjective, the whole believing somethign and making it true. this seems almost tautological: how can something be true
outside of any belief of a person or collective, when truth is defined by that collective? so with that in mind, all that we observe
is art: a cat, itself an idea, with a species, genus, etc., ideas, composed of cells, organs, ideas, further broken down into
atoms and molecules, which would seem to be obviously 'real' but when you think about it are just things that the most of us
agree on. a cat is no different from a piano piece.

(this definition would also allow us to say that simply, art is art!)

this would make everyone an artist, which seems a fitting way to do justice to us all. even with all of our differences, we all share
the ability (and to an extent, the imperative) to make art and thus be an artist. at least to me, an interesting way to describe
humanity: the largest ever art collective.

full confession, i started writing this hoping for justification of this very site as a piece of art, and i ended up with this. i
think that, regardless of whether i found my pettyjustification, i got something more interesting to ponder. i hope anyone reading
this feels the same.
