    <p>
        i feel some sort of obligation to add content here. so here's a thought:
        subjectivity. my reality can be whatever i believe it to be. sure, you can tell
        me 'that isn't true!' it isn't true to you. in your reality it isn't. in mine it
        is. you can't change that. simple enough.
