    <pre>
    my reflection is dirty and cleanliness is godliness
    theres no connection im intoxicated with the madness
    im your lover 
    im bullshit
    im the facem the fashion victim
    so save your prayers for when i never let on
    throw out your cares i never let on
    wanna blame yourself? for what
    shes the one for me shes all you blame yourself for
    shes the one shes the one for me shes all
    shes emptiness and shes loneliness and shes the one
    and cleanliness is godliness and god, shes my one
    shes empty just like me
    connection to myself in love
    your zero enchanted kingdoms
    your dreams of glass chew their charcoal teeth
    when were you really gonna need them 
    i was on a sinking ship
    care and fly for a ride what you cant ignore
    all i really need oh yeah 
    wanting more
    one for me, i really need it oh yeah
    and loneliness is cleanliness, one for me
    god is empty just like me, one and only
