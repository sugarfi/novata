                        At first I thought that Exto wasn't working correctly. I started off just jotting stuff down, and it kept it,
                        but I didn't get any of the promised memory exercises! I thought maybe there was some sort of threshold, so I added
                        more to it. I added a bit more, and a bit more, and more, and more, and then one day it worked and the AI power
                        kicked in! - u/[deleted], via reddit
